      <h1> Multi-Agent Systems</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p align="left" ><b>The aim of multi-agent systems is to understand how 
        independent processes can be coordinated. </b></p>
      <p align="left" >An agent is a computerized entity like a computer programme 
        or a robot. An agent can be described as autonomous because it has the 
        capacity to adapt when its environment changes. A multi-agent system is 
        made up of a set of computer processes that occur at the same time, i.e. 
        several agents that exist at the same time, share common resources and 
        communicate with each other. The key issue in multi-agent systems is to 
        formalize the coordination between agents. Research on agents, therefore, 
        includes research into: </p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Decision-making</b> : what decision-making mechanisms are available 
          to the agent? What is the link between their perceptions, representations, 
          and actions ? </li>
        <li><b>Control </b>: what hierarchic relationships exist between agents 
          ? How are they synchronized ? </li>
        <li><b>Communication </b>: what kind of messages do they send each other? 
          What syntax do these messages obey ?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Multi-agent systems can be applied to artificial intelligence. They simplify 
        problem-solving by dividing the necessary knowledge into subunits-to which 
        an independent intelligent agent is associated-and by coordinating the 
        agents' activity. In this way, we refer to distributed artificial intelligence. 
      </p>
      <p>This method can be used for monitoring an industrial process, for example, 
        when the sensible solution -that of coordinating several specialized monitors 
        rather than a single omniscient one- is adopted. </p>
      <p>Fundamental research is being conducted on the problems associated with 
        the representation of agents' decisions and protocols for communication. 
        The main applications for MAS are for telecommunications, internet, and 
        physical agents, such as robots. A group of scientists has specialized 
        in the simulation of agents' societies in the fields of ecology and social 
        sciences. Research on modelling distributed systems has also been conducted 
        by computer scientists, ecologists, and social scientists. Here, we discuss 
        a few references and some of the issues involved. </p>
      <h2>MAS and Ecology </h2>
      <p>In ecology, the distributed approaches or individual-based models (IBM) 
        were developed at the end of the 1980s. The most frequently quoted article 
        is that written by Huston who puts forward two reasons for developing 
        this approach: firstly, there is the need to take into account the individual 
        because of their genetic uniqueness and, secondly, the fact that each 
        individual is situated and their interactions are local. The argument 
        clearly had an impact because numerous publications refer to this approach. 
        Shortly after Huston's publication, Hogeweg and Hesper published a similar 
        article on "individual-oriented modelling". The latter had more influence 
        on scientists working in the field of artificial life. Then, in 1990, 
        there was a congress in Knoxville on "Individual-based models and approaches 
        in ecology". The congress proceedings were published and have since been 
        the main reference text on the subject. Above all, truly individual-based 
        models, or so-called i-state configuration models have been used for the 
        object-oriented approach, for example, the work by Silvert, Derry, and 
        Roese. There are several models of forests. The most striking application 
        is undoubtedly the Across Trophic Level System Simulation (<a href="http://www.atlss.org/atlss_frame.html">ATLSS</a>) 
        model which attempts to simulate the ecological function of the Everglades 
        in Florida. This model represents abiotic factors-such as hydrology, fire, 
        and hurricanes-and different trophic levels simultaneously. Within the 
        models, which can be mathematical compartmental models, different animal 
        populations are simulated (deer, fish) with the help of individual-based 
        models. Craig Reynolds proposes a rich list of <a href="http://www.atlss.org/atlss_frame.html">classifyied 
        and annotated links relative to IBM's</a>.</p>
      <h2>MAS and social sciences </h2>
      <p>MAS are developing rapidly in the field of social sciences. Society simulation 
        is the subject of numerous conferences, for example, Multi-agent Systems 
        and Agent-Based Simulation (MABS). Research on the subject is published 
        in the electronic journal <a href="http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/JASSS.html">Jasss</a> 
        (Journal of artificial societies and simulation). In addition, a group 
        called Agent-based Computational Economics (<a href="http://www.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/ace.htm">ACE</a>) 
        has been set up. </p>
      <p>In social sciences, the application of multiagent universes to simulate 
        social phenomena is generally associated with the sociological trend, 
        so-called "individualism", in which the singular individual is considered 
        as the elementary unit or the atom of society. The overlap is, in fact, 
        in the bottom-up approach which characterizes MAS. However, the assimilation 
        between individuals from a society and agents from a multi-agent universe 
        can be misleading. In fact, it is quite possible for social groups and 
        institutions to be considered as agents with their own standards and rules. 
        The agents are directed by constraints or rules that are expressed on 
        a group level, i.e. they are no more than entities that act and are placed 
        in a dynamic environment. </p>
      <p>This straightforward comment -which is natural when MAS are used for 
        modelling- shows how the simple duality that exists between individualism 
        and holism can be called into question. It is a major preoccupation for 
        researchers working on renewable resource management and MAS : </p>
      <ol>
        <li>individuals, products of history, are driven by collective values 
          and rules, </li>
        <li>collective values and rules evolve because of the interaction between 
          individuals and between groups, </li>
        <li>the individuals are neither similar nor equal but have their own specific 
          roles and social status. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>How do individuals make up a group ? How is an institution created ? 
        The individual cannot be considered as an autonomous entity that is independent 
        of its social environment. How are individuals constrained by the collective 
        structures that they themselves have set up and how do they make these 
        structures evolve ? What degrees of freedom are given to the definition 
        of individual practices ? Here are just some of the questions that can 
        be explored using MAS and which can be expressed as follows: "how are 
        collective structures set up and how do they function when they are based 
        on agents with different capacities of representation, that exchange information, 
        goods or services, etc., draw up contracts, and are thrust into a dynamic 
        environment which responds to their actions ?" </p>
      <h2>MAS and interactions between societies and resources </h2>
      <p>The problem with modelling common resource management is how to simulate 
        the interaction between groups of agents and resource dynamics. There 
        are several empirical ways of modelling these interactions. </p>
      <p>The first method involves simulating how social networks are managed. 
        Here, we consider that the relationships between people and resources 
        should, in fact, be rephrased as the relationships between people who 
        affect resources. Agents that exchange messages within networks or so-called 
        contact networks can be simulated with MAS. In this way, it is possible 
        to simulate exchanges of information and services as well as contracts 
        and agreements between agents. For example, in the case of irrigated systems, 
        farmer agents can send each other messages so that they know what the 
        water levels are in different plots. They can also ask for or exchange 
        services or addresses. In this way, it has been shown that the evolution 
        of a system can be very sensitive to the structure and dynamics of social 
        networks. </p>
      <p>In the second method, emphasis is put on the cognitive processes or representations 
        that determine how agents and resources interact. Each agent develops 
        and then acts on its own representation of a resource. In so doing, the 
        agent transforms the resource for the other agents. This model represents 
        interactions that are close to what economists call externalities. We 
        study the problem of managing common renewable resources by examining 
        the different representations of actions that affect the resources in 
        question. The resulting resource use may or may not be satisfactory for 
        the agents. This can be described as coordination through the environment.</p>
      <p> This method of classification provides a framework in which applied 
        models can take into account both the agents' interactions and systems 
        of exchanges through the environment. </p>
