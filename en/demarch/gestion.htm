      <h1>Two Approaches for Managing Resources</h1>
      <p>&nbsp;
      <p>Several scientists are working on natural resource management. Here, 
        we mention two groups that are linked to two research associations, the 
        International Society of Ecological Economics (ISEE) and the International 
        Association for the Study of Common Property (IASCP). The former association 
        conducts research with a view to integrating ecological systems within 
        economic frameworks. The latter is involved in the management of common 
        property, particularly renewable natural resources.</p>
      <h2>Economic approach</h2>
      <p>The economics of natural resources and the environment provides a set 
        of theories and conceptual tools to monitor, analyse, evaluate, and regulate 
        (Dales, 1968; Arrow and Fisher, 1974; Bromley, 1991). In particular, economics 
        provides a model for the sustainable use of renewable natural resources 
        in the form of management tools, such as taxes, quotas, grants, subsidies, 
        standards, licences, permits, property rights, and market rights. </p>
      <p>In addition, environmental economics relies on a representation of the 
        circular interaction between humans and nature. The environment provides 
        services to society which can be quantified. In return, Man transforms 
        the environment-this action constitutes an externality-and by so doing, 
        restricts the decisions that can be made by other agents. Appropriate 
        policies and management tools can be used to ensure that natural services 
        are used efficiently and to compensate for the externalities. Economic 
        methods of monetary evaluation can be applied to both services and externalities. 
      </p>
      <p>Thus, different possible uses of an ecosystem or a landscape can be compared. 
        Economic methods of evaluation-based on the capacity to clarify representations-can 
        be applied to several types of problems. They are presented as negotiation 
        methods for stakeholders. </p>
      <p>One of the weaknesses of the economic approach is its failure to account 
        for the temporal dimension when it comes to finding a balance between 
        resources and society. </p>
      <p><b>Ecological economics</b> has improved on this by adding the concept 
        of the co-adaptation between the natural and social worlds. In addition, 
        the dynamics differ from a series of balanced situations. Systemic models 
        that represent the dynamics using stocks-flux relationships are often 
        used (Clark, 1990). </p>
      <h2>Common pool resources</h2>
      <p>An international association for the study of common property (IASCP) 
        was set up in the late 1980s. However, its origins date back to the publication 
        in 1968 of G. Hardin's theory of the failure of the commons. In fact, 
        the author expressed the view that a common resource exploited by rational 
        economic agents is bound to disappear because of over-exploitation. Different 
        solutions have subsequently been put forward to solve the problem: privatization 
        or the establishment of a central authority responsible for managing the 
        access to resources, i.e. to control it by using economic or administrative 
        management tools. </p>
      <p>The most outspoken critics of Hardin's article have demonstrated that 
        the failure is not due to the common nature of the resources but to the 
        fact that there is free access. There are numerous examples to show that 
        a community can manage a common resource sustainably. </p>
      <p>Several authors, such as Ostrom (1990; 1999), Berkes et al (1989), and 
        Stevenson (1991) disagree with Hardin's view that successful collective 
        action is impossible. They present the principles of an institutional 
        approach based on formal or informal regulatory mechanisms that govern 
        the viability of ecosystems. This governance makes reference to stakeholder 
        representations and is based on the principle of negotiation. </p>
      <p>Local approaches tend to be ineffective because of interference from 
        external actors or constraints beyond the locality (at different scales). 
        Research is now focusing on the concept of co-management (McCay and Jones, 
        1997). If co-management can be applied when different stakeholders use 
        a given resource for the same purpose (for example, fishermen or members 
        of an association of catchment areas), then the issue now is to extend 
        it to resources with multiple uses. This requires other forms of arbitration 
        and collective decisions. </p>
