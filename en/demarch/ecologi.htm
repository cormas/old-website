      <h2>Ecology and natural resources dynamics</h2>

      <p>The scientific approach to natural resource dynamics involves the characterization 
        of how the environment influences the abundance and availability of a 
        given resource. From the ecological point of view, the environment is 
        a collection of natural factors (physical, chemical, and biological) capable 
        of affecting living organisms. Therefore, any factor that can be consumed 
        or used by an organism is defined as a natural resource (Begon et al, 
        1990). </p>
      <p>The "individual - environment - population" system (Barbault, 1992), 
        which is at the heart of ecological thought, presents a multitude of intertwined 
        interactions that can be grouped into one of two categories: interactions 
        between organisms (competition, predation, mutualism, etc.), and interactions 
        between organisms and their physical environment (the environmental "conditions"). 
      </p>
      <p>In essence, ecology deals with the study of complex systems. A complex 
        entity (Fogelman Soulié, 1991; Gell-Mann, 1994) is composed of different 
        elements that interact and combine in a way that may not be obvious at 
        first: the system's complexity is in the eye of the observer. </p>
      <p>The idea that the concept of complexity is inseparable from perception 
        is not neutral but depends on the scale of observation of the system under 
        study. In ecology, there is no scale for observing all phenomena. Conventionally, 
        the hierarchy of scales (Allen and Starr, 1982) refers to organizational 
        levels: cell, organism, population, community, ecosystems, landscapes, 
        biome, biosphere. One of the major issues in ecology is the ability to 
        take into account the multiplicity of scales of study so that each of 
        the phenomena studied at their specific levels can be integrated during 
        a phase called "scale transfer". </p>

      <h2 align="left" >Interactions between scales and disciplines</h2>

      <p align="left" >The research community is divided between those who are 
        working on ethology and individual behaviour and those working on the 
        ecology of the landscape and the structure or organization of space. Significant 
        advances in ecology have been limited as a result. </p>
      <p align="left" >Let us consider, for example, one of the common and relevant 
        problems that occurs in managing renewable natural resources: estimating 
        the risk of extinction of a species as a function of space fragmentation. 
        In order to make an estimation, we need to know the global indicators 
        for the spatial structuring of the landscape. However, we also need to 
        know about the processes involved in animal migration and habitat selection, 
        for example. These mechanisms can explain how the system functions. They 
        should be taken into account in any model that seeks to give meaning to 
        the indicators defined at a higher level. </p>
      <p align="left" >Interdisciplinary combinations, which are essential for 
        environmental sciences, are generally manifest on a global level. Landscape 
        ecology (Forman and Gordon, 1986; Kareiva and Wennergren, 1995) is where 
        geography and ecology come together. It is based on the principle that 
        environmental problems generally go beyond the conventional limits of 
        one or other subject and that their solutions require not only an understanding 
        of the physical and ecological aspects of the ecosystems but also of the 
        way they interact with political, economic, and social factors. </p>
