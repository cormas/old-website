      <h1>Research on Modelling and Resource Management within Cirad</h1>
      <h1>&nbsp; </h1>
      <p>Environmental research includes issues relating to natural resources 
        and externalities. It deals with the management of renewable resources 
        and production externalities (i.e. pollution) as well as the management 
        of ecosystems that are used for diverse purposes. In general, the aim 
        is to define and implement rules for the collective use of resources. 
        When resources and externalities are analysed, it is important to take 
        into account natural and social dynamics. <b>Natural dynamics</b> are 
        characterized by the interaction of multiple processes involving different 
        species and resources at different spatial and temporal scales. <b>Social 
        processes</b> involve different stakeholders and several organizational 
        levels, ranging from individuals and user communities to large development 
        institutions. </p>
      <p>Within CIRAD, the Green project "renewable resource management and the 
        environment" -set up in 1993 by Jacques Weber- seeks to present local 
        and global processes for managing multipurpose resources. Research focuses 
        on two areas: appropriation modes and decision-making processes (Weber, 
        1993).</p>
      <p>The <b>appropriation modes</b> bring together questions of representation, 
        access, use, transfer, and distribution of resources. The analysis of 
        appropriation modes leads to the examination of institutions and management 
        modes.</p>
      <p>The study of <b>decision-making processes</b> involves the examination 
        of interactions between stakeholders with different weights and representations 
        in order to understand their dynamics and develop negotiation aids.</p>
      <p>To progress further in the analysis of interactions, a domain of research 
        will have to be specified: that of the relation between scale and the 
        viability of interactions. The criteria and constraints of viability are 
        not the same at the level of the village, the region, or the world. One 
        has to understand the links between the implementation of management tools 
        and the viability of interactions at different spatial and organizational 
        scales. </p>
      <h2>Integration between levels</h2>
      <p>Our project does not attempt to answer all the above questions. However, 
        one problem appears to be a lateral one, i.e. the integration of dynamics 
        on several spatial scales and organizational levels. Two conflicting approaches 
        can be used to represent a system. The first involves examining the global 
        dynamics of organizations by putting together local dynamics. The second 
        starts with local interactions and builds up to organizations. Our research 
        reflects the duality between: the ecology of individuals and the landscape, 
        local and regional natural resource management, local management of common 
        property and economic or legal management tools. </p>
      <p>When considering resource management, it is important to go beyond this 
        bipolarity and address the problem of how these different levels can be 
        integrated. </p>
      <h2>Simulating interactions to help collective management</h2>
      <p>In order to address this problem, we have developed modelling tools that 
        can simulate interactions on several scales as well as a methodological 
        approach to using these tools. </p>
      <p>Collective management can be facilitated by the use of decision-making 
        and negotiating tools which represent the interdependence of stakeholders 
        concerned with managing the different problems. They can also be used 
        to examine the different representations of stakeholders (from the producer 
        to the manager). </p>
      <p>These tools are based on modelling complex systems in order to understand 
        spatial and social dynamics. This begs the question as to how economic 
        and geographic approaches can be integrated in a model based on behaviour 
        and interactions. We propose combining tools that characterize spatial 
        structures -such as GIS or spatial-analysis software- and tools which 
        simulate interactions, eg. cellular automata or multi-agent systems. </p>
      <p>The approach facilitates the decision-making process by using an artificial 
        world to demonstrate the diversity of local dynamics and potential regulatory 
        processes and the fact that management tools can have a wider impact (regionally 
        and nationally). It is also important to compare results from different 
        scenarios in order to facilitate the decision-making process. The study 
        of interaction indicators and methods -so that values can be attributed 
        to different scenarios- is also an essential part of the <b>accompanying 
        process</b>. </p>
