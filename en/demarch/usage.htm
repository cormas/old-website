      <h1>Use of Modelling</h1>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>One of the classic uses of simulation is for prediction. However, this 
        is not the option we have chosen. The long-term economic and social future 
        can not be predicted, although it can be partially decidable according 
        to the hypothesis underlying the "patrimonial approach" (De Montgolfier 
        and Natali, 1988; Ollagnon, 1989). <i>"Because the very long term is beyond 
        the scope of prediction, if we wish to take it into account in the analysis 
        of environmental problems, we must give ourselves very long-term reference 
        points or objectives to guide the possible or impossible pathways of development. 
        The long-term approach must inevitably be based on a scenario"</i> (Weber, 
        1993).The rules are legitimate in the stakeholders' eyes because they 
        are the result of interaction between stakeholders and they incorporate 
        particular perceptions. </p>
      <p>Stakeholders can "decide" very long-term objectives on the basis of a 
        shared conception of how the present situation should evolve. The scenarios 
        which enable these objectives to be reached can then be discussed on that 
        basis. The entire mediation approach presupposes that the stakeholders 
        are well informed of the issues dividing them and of the fact that they 
        all have an interest in solving the original problem. </p>
      <p>The challenge of the initialization phase is to allow stakeholders to 
        express how they perceive the present situation and its evolution. When 
        a "map of perceptions"-all equally legitimate and equally subjective-has 
        been established and discussed, the stakeholders are asked to discuss 
        whether it is acceptable to continue with existing tendencies. How can 
        simulations be involved in this process, i.e. how can they help stakeholders 
        to manage resources? We are trying to develop the concept of companion 
        modelling using multi-agent systems. The ideas presented below are part 
        of an approach which is now being implemented although it has only been 
        partially tested. The approach is undoubtedly original in terms of its 
        use of multi-agent systems, however, it has already been used by several 
        researchers (Ostrom, 1990; Burton, 1994) whose work has provided the basis 
        for our studies. Mermet (1992) and Piveteau (1994) have done a great deal 
        of work-using role playing-on the relation between the patrimonial approach 
        and the placing of stakeholders in an experimental situation. Our rationale 
        is similar to that of these authors and we propose that the MAS modelling 
        approach be put in this context. </p>
