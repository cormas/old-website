      </ul>

      <p>The model consists of a two dimensional grid, wrapped in both axes to 

        avoid edge effects, containing two kinds of agents: plants and foragers. 

        The main idea is the study of the survival of two populations of agents 

        that depends on the spatial configuration. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h4>Dynamics of the plants</h4>

      <p>To control the distribution of plants as an experimental variable, plants 

        are created only at the start of a run, and do not move, die, or reproduce. 

        A plant&#146;s only &#147;behaviors&#148; is to grow and be eaten, while 

        foragers move about seeking and eating plants, reproducing, and dying.</p>

      <p>Plants have a fixed location in a given grid cell, and vary only in their 

        size, which represents the amount of food energy available to foragers. 

        At the start of a run each plant&#146;s initial size is set to a uniform 

        random number between zero and a fixed maximum. At each time step this 

        energy level increases according to a logistic growth curve.</p>

      <p>At the start of a run each initial forager is endowed with an energy 

        level chosen as a uniform random number between zero and the fertility 

        threshold, and placed on a randomly chosen cell containing a plant.</p>

      <h4>Dynamics of the foragers</h4>

      <p><img src="../../images/applica/ecec-2.gif" width="321" height="323" align="left">At 

        the start of a run each initial forager is endowed with an energy level 

        chosen as a uniform random number between zero and the fertility threshold, 

        and placed on a randomly chosen cell containing a plant. A forager feeds 

        on the plant in its current cell if there is one. It increases its own 

        energy store by the same amount it reduces the plant&#146;s.</p>

      <p>Foragers are of two types that differes in their feeding behavior. When 

        &#147;restrained&#148; foragers eat, they take only 50% of the plant&#146;s 

        energy. In contrast, &#147;unrestrained&#148; foragers eat 99% of the 

        plant. This parameter is less than 100% so that plants can continue to 

        grow after being fed on, rather than being permanently destroyed.</p>

      <h5>Rules for Foragers&#146; Movements</h5>

      <p>Foragers examine their current and eight adjacent cells, and from those 

        not occupied by another forager, choose the cell containing the plant 

        with the most energy (with ties broken randomly). </p>

      <p>If the chosen cell would yield enough food to meet their metabolic cost 

        for one time step they move there. (This fixed metabolic cost per time 

        step is the same for all foragers.) If not, they move instead to a randomly 

        chosen adjacent cell not occupied by another forager. </p>

      <p>This movement rule leads to the emigration of foragers from depleted 

        patches, and simulates the behavior of individuals exploiting local food 

        sources while they last, but migrating rather than starving in an inadequate 

        food patch. </p>

      <h5>Other Biological Functions of Foragers</h5>

      <p>Foragers also loose energy each time step as a fixed metabolic cost, 

        regardless of whether or not they move. If their energy store reachs zero 

        they die, but they do not have maximum life spans. </p>

      <p>If a forager&#146;s energy level reachs an upper fertility threshold 

        it reproduces asexually, creating an offspring with the same heritable 

        traits as itself (e.g., feeding strategy). At the same time the parent&#146;s 

        energy store is reduced by the offspring&#146;s initial energy. Newborn 

        offspring occupy the cell nearest to their parent that is not already 

        occupied by a forager. </p>

      <p>This analysis shows that &quot;unrestrained&quot; populations of foragers 

        survive with some fluctuations according to the capacity of the environment, 

        while the &quot;retrained&quot; populations colapse. But, in some cases, 

        the &quot;restrained&quot; population may survive. With the Cormas analysis 

        module, it is now possible to record the value of the random seed (Sim22 

        (seed=3230785234493) = the red curves), and to run a new simulation with 

        this value to observe and analyse this specific simulation. This can be 

        done by adding a line in the &quot;init&quot; method of the model :</p>
