      <h1>MARKETS : Markets as communication systems </h1>
      <h2>Assessing the performance of different market institutions using computer 
        simulations</h2>
      <p>Franck Galtier, Cirad.</p>
      <p>The famous work by F. Hayek, L. Hurwicz, J. Stiglitz, and S. Grossman 
        showed that market performance depends on an ability to ensure the dissemination 
        of information between economic stakeholders. As information is passed 
        on by the processes of negotiation and trade, the type of trading network 
        plays a crucial role since it determines the architecture of the channels 
        through which information flows. Recent work has analysed this aspect 
        using mathematical tools (Kirman 1983; Ioannides 2002) or computer tools 
        (Kirman and Vriend 2000; Kerber and Saam 2001). The work described here 
        falls into the second category.</p>
      <p>It involved a comparative analysis of the performance of two modes of 
        wholesale trade organization widely used in agricultural commodity chains 
        of the developing countries: network trading and marketplace trading.</p>

      <p>These two institutions function very differently. In the case of a trading 
        network, each wholesaler in a consumer zone (CW) has correspondents (PW) 
        in the different production zones (one per zone) and, in principle, should 
        only procure supplies from his correspondents. Thus, when a CW wishes 
        to buy maize or millet, he contacts his correspondents in different locations 
        (usually by telephone, or by mail delivered by truckers or taxi drivers), 
        centralizes the sale proposals made by each of them (in terms of price, 
        quality, delivery date, terms of payment, etc.) and enters into transactions 
        with the one making the most interesting bid. The entire process of negotiation 
        and exchange takes place at a distance. In the case of wholesale markets, 
        CWs circulate in the production zones, where they meet PWs in the marketplaces 
        (on market day). The dissemination of information is therefore very different 
        in the two types of institution.</p>

        Wholesale markets in K&eacute;tou (B&eacute;nin)</p>
      <p>Discussion on the relative performances of these two institutions has 
        major repercussions for public policies. Indeed, States and funding agencies 
        tend to favour wholesale markets, which are judged to be preferable for 
        ensuring market &quot;transparency&quot;. It is this idea that we have 
        attempted to test here, by analysing whether any situations exist where 
        trading networks prove to be better communication systems than wholesale 
        markets.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="../../images/applica/markets-EN.jpg" width="479" height="204" align="right">The 
        analysis was based on computer simulations using a multi-agent system 
        (MAS). The approach consisted in &quot;entering&quot; an (environment, 
        market institution) pair in the model, simulating the induced exchange 
        processes and measuring the efficacy of the resource allocation obtained 
        in that way (in accordance with a previously defined performance criterion). 
        This approach (shown in the following graph) makes it possible to test 
        the comparative efficacy of wholesale trading networks and wholesale markets 
        in different environments (to see their respective scope of relevance).<br>
        In the scenarios performed, the <i>environment</i> was modelled from two 
        sets of variables: the degree to which the activity was concentrated on 
        the level of production zone wholesalers (PWs) and the variability in 
        supplies to those wholesalers. The <i>market institutions</i> represented 
        were trading networks and wholesale markets, along with an imaginary &quot;perfect&quot; 
        institution, i.e. one which enabled total market transparency and optimum 
        allocation of resources. This last institution was used as a control to 
        measure the efficiency of the other two. Lastly, the <i>performance criterion</i> 
        adopted was the minimization of rationing in consumption localities. </p>
      <p>The simulations involved 150 different scenarios (50 environments and 
        3 market institutions). Each of the 150 scenarios was simulated over 100 
        time periods, approximately corresponding to two farming seasons, taking 
        a model time period to be a week in reality (numerous marketplaces operate 
        on a weekly basis). A thousand simulations were carried out for each scenario, 
        in order to neutralize the effect of the random variables introduced into 
        the model. </p>
      <h3>The main results were as follows :</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Whilst networks and wholesale markets disseminate far fewer bits of 
          information than the control institution, they manage to generate an 
          allocation of resources that is almost as good (at least when the environment 
          is unstable, which tallies with numerous true situations). This is confirmation 
          of the intuition of F. Hayek and L. Hurwicz whereby market institutions 
          that are relatively economical in terms of disseminating information 
          can lead to an efficient allocation of resources.</li>
        <li>The most decisive (environment) variable for the comparative performance 
          of the two institutions was the number of production zone wholesalers 
          (PWs). In fact, when there are 15 PWs, networks always prove to be more 
          efficient than wholesale markets, whereas the opposite is the case with 
          30 PWs. This result fits in with the empirical reality of the cereal 
          markets in Mali and Benin. Indeed, in Mali, the activity is highly concentrated 
          at PW level: there are only around ten per stockpiling locality. Conversely, 
          in Benin, this activity is covered by smaller scale PWs in larger numbers 
          (between 60 and 150 depending on the stockpiling localities). Yet it 
          is actually in Mali (where the PWs are larger scale and fewer in number) 
          that trading networks are found and in Benin (where PW activity is far 
          more scattered) that wholesale markets are found.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This result is contrary to the preconception whereby wholesale markets 
        are better communication systems than trading networks. This should logically 
        lead to a total rethink of public policies in this field (which are currently 
        geared towards promoting wholesale markets).</p>
      <p>Computer modelling of market processes proved to be relevant in explaining 
        how an efficient allocation of resources can result from the decentralized 
        interactions of numerous individuals among whom the information is dispersed. 
        This approach thus complements other tools such as the games theory or 
        market experimentation [Smith 1982; Roth 2001]. Its strong points are 
        that it enables an analysis of market processes within which transactions 
        take place &quot;out of balance&quot; (which is difficult with the games 
        theory), and involves numerous stakeholders and quite long time periods 
        (which experiments do not allow). </p>
      <p>This work also opens up a certain number of research prospects. One of 
        them consists in including elements related to the &quot;language&quot; 
        of the market institutions. Indeed, The messages (embodied in the purchase 
        and sale proposals of the players) are expressed according to rules that 
        define how the different trading parameters should be qualified (price, 
        quantity, quality, payment and delivery deadlines, and delivery site) 
        and how they should be negotiated. These rules (which constitute the &quot;market 
        language&quot;) can also be assessed using computer simulations.</p>
