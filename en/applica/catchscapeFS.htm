 <h1>CatchScapeFS </h1>
 <h1>Assessment of farming systems sustainability <br>
      in Northern Thailand </h1>

      <p align="left">The CatchScapeFS model was developed in  order to evaluate the sustainability of farming systems in the study area of Bor  Krai village, Mae Hong Son province, Thailand.  Integrated modelling of the present study provides new opportunities to  evaluate and monitor sustainability situation and deliver information for  policy development. The sustainability of farming systems in the study area is  under stress due to tension on resource use, population growth, land  limitation, and increasing market options. In long run, this situation may  result in food insecurity, shift of farming systems to market orientation, and  increasing environmental problems e.g. soil erosion and land degradation.</p>
      <img width="224" height="162" src="http://cormas.cirad.fr/images/applica/CatchScapeFS_SpatialGrid.gif" align="left" hspace="12">The  model is composed of two principle components: biophysical and  socioeconomic.&nbsp; The biophysical component  is based on CatchScape3 model (Becu et al., 2003) which consists of biophysical  sub-models: a hydrological model, a crop model, a water balance model, and a  soil erosion model embedded in the study area&rsquo;s landscape model which is  divided into spatial grid cells representing agricultural plots of one rai  (0.16 ha)
      (see beside the study area representation in Cormas).
      <p>Socioeconomic <em>component</em> is composed of farm household agents and the other social  elements determined based on farming system approach (Potchanasin et al.,  2008). Decision making processes are structured following behavior heuristics  presented in decision tree diagram. This approach has been selected among an  alternative option, optimization approach. The approach has been selected with concerning  about flexibility to involve qualitative factors, considering search cost to  model agents&rsquo; bounded rationality, advancing in communication with stakeholders  and advancing to integrate agents&rsquo; ability to perceive environment and  communication among agent society (Potchanasin, C. 2008). </p>
      <p>To generate farm agents, cluster analysis and  qualitative analysis were applied together with Monte   Carlo techniques (<a href="http://cormas.cirad.fr/images/applica/CatchScapeFS_Fig3.tif" target="_blank">figure</a>). This analysis allowed defining a consistent  characteristic distribution between the agent population and the farm samples. Each simulation time step corresponds to a  10 day time interval and consists of six phases (biophysical dynamics, farm household  activities, socioeconomic dynamics, information exchanges and result  arrangements). The farm household activities consist of eight sub-phases:  knowledge base updating, household resource updating, cropping activities,  household activities, harvesting, selling farm products, financial activities  and livestock activities. The model validation was conducted through social  validation (diagram elicitation approach) and statistic data comparison  validation.</p>
      The  model simulations deliver sustainability evaluation results. Sustainability of  the study area was evaluated at two level, household and village level, &nbsp;covering 15 year starting by 2003 until 2017  (Potchanasin et al., 2008). At household level, sustainability was assessed  based on farm agents&rsquo; performance which this is why agent-based modelling is  chosen. At village level, sustainability was assessed through Sustainability  index and Performance index which these enhance determination of sustainability  issue and comparison across defined indicators
