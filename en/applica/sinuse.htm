      <h2>A tool to explore distributed interactions between a water table and 
        its users</h2>
      <p>Sarah Feuillette, Ird.<img src="/images/applica/sinuse1.jpg" width="236" height="330" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10" alt="Un pompage en Tunisie"></p>
      <p>The Sinuse model (Simulation of interactions between water table and 
        water users) is designed to explore the ways of managing the demands made 
        on an over-exploited water table: it should allow the definition of engines 
        of system dynamics and of testing the effectiveness of different types 
        of interventions, all while taking into account their social impact, key 
        to their ultimate acceptance by the users. Sinuse has been developed for 
        the case study of the Kairouan water table in Central Tunisia, over-exploited 
        for the past twenty years, mainly by private wells (see following figure, 
        showing evolution of the average water table level between years 1969 
        and 1999).</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="/images/applica/sinuse1.gif" width="240" height="118" name="NiveauNappe"></p>
      <p>Individual strategies and interactions between agriculturists have been 
        determined on the basis of surveys whose results have led us to the following 
        hypothesis: all the agriculturists of the Kairouan plain have the same 
        overall aim of acquiring or extending irrigation to alleviate their climate's 
        aridity. The strategies used towards this aim depend on their plots, families, 
        economics, access to resources, and neighbors' situations: a plot or group 
        of neighboring plots should be large enough to make the well cost-effective. 
        Since the water table is homogenous as to depth and structure, the access 
        and extraction cost depend on the location over the water table and, finally, 
        the presence of working wells in the neighborhood is an indicator of the 
        accessibility of the water table and a social stimulant (whereas a disused 
        well acts as a disincentive). This imitation process is reflected in the 
        spatial dynamics of the appearance of wells.</p>
      <p>The zone under study extends to about 25,000 hectares. The Sinuse model 
        represents a simplified and reduced plan of the system under study (approximately 
        10% of the system under study) while respecting, as far as possible, the 
        proportions of the main parameters. It attempts to find a coherence between 
        phenomena observed on the field and to be able to validate the model to 
        some extent. The time step of interactions is the year, divided into two 
        seasons.</p>
      <p>The Sinuse model consists of three types of entities (see the following 
        figure): ·</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Social entities, the Users, who represent the farmers of the area, 
          all endowed with rules of action that mainly depend on their family, 
          economic, plot, and water-access situations. </li>
        <li>Spatial entities more or less aggregated, such as the zones of the 
          water table that communicate between themselves, the plots whose cropping 
          system and irrigation changes with the seasons, the irrigation perimeters 
          that distribute water at a fixed tariff and with a given distribution 
          efficiency to the plots that form part of it. </li>
        <li>Passive (and fixed) entities such as wells, which appear and disappear 
          during the simulation (construction and abandoning), can be deepened, 
          be functional or non-functional, can irrigate several plots depending 
          on their capacity, and whose construction and extraction price depends 
          on the depth of water. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following figure shows the interactions represented by the Sinuse 
        model..</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="/images/applica/sinuse2.gif" width="471" height="163" name="Modele" alt="Interactions repr&eacute;sent&eacute;es par Sinuse"></p>
      <p>The users make basic exchanges and crop-planting and harvesting decisions. 
        The irrigation of plots results in a sampling at the level of water points 
        which transmit information to the water-table zone they belong to. These 
        react by lowering themselves and the resulting piezometric gradient leads 
        to transfers of volume between zones. Each Zone of the water table communicates 
        its new depth to plots which may lead to deepening of wells (on the condition 
        of non-indebtedness). The results of each agricultural season is calculated 
        and, at year end, depending on his budget, his savings, and his situation, 
        the agriculturist can consider construction of a well, if necessary in 
        association with a neighbor, or by buying or selling a plot.</p>
      <p>Wells can also be constructed according to several types of procedures 
        (on a small or large plot, in association with a neighbor or not,…) to 
        which the users do not assign the same preference. In case of poverty, 
        a user could be forced to sell a plot.</p>
      <p>The following figure shows the simplified running of a time step. Each 
        class is shown by a dotted vertical line; the activation of objects of 
        the class is shown by a rectangle on the life line. The objects communicate 
        by exchanging messages represented by horizontal arrows, pointing from 
        transmitter to the receiver.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="/images/applica/sinuse3.gif" width="445" height="306" alt="Sch&eacute;ma UML de Sinuse"></p>
      <p>The display of the appearance of wells is made possible by the graphical 
        interface of the model (see following figure).</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="/images/applica/sinuse4.gif" width="378" height="212" alt="Interface graphique de Sinuse"></p>
      <p>The progression of wells (new wells in red) takes place more by densification 
        of zones that are already occupied rather than by new ones in "pioneering" 
        zones: in 7 successive time steps, the construction of wells in the virgin 
        zone took place only in the second time step. Wells are historically concentrated 
        in zones that are not deep (growing depth gradient from right to left). 
        The rate of appearance of wells decreases with time because of spatial 
        constraints and the lowering of the water table.</p>
