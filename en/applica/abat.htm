      <h1>Abat: an agent-based model on the hunting of blue duikers in the Northern 
        periphery of Korup National Park, Cameroon </h1>

      <p><img src="/images/applica/abat.jpg" width="380" height="338" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10" alt="Un pompage en Tunisie">Since 
        June 2009, several studies have been carried out in the Northern peripheral 
        zone of Korup national park on the livelihoods of local population and 
        the status and use of wildlife. The data collected have been introduced 
        in an agent-based model to integrate the existing knowledge in a simulation 
        tool aiming at promoting discussions among local villagers and scientists 
        to collectively explore possible options to enhance a sustainable wildlife 
        management in the area. In July 2012, a set of 3 workshops has been organized 
        by the University of Dschang and the French research Institute CIRAD with 
        the participation of local villagers in order to share the preliminary 
        results of some studies conducted in the area. The first version of the 
        &quot;Abat&quot; agent-based model, representing the hunting of blue duikers 
        (Cephalophus monticola) by using snare trap technique, has been used to 
        demonstrate and educate the population on the importance of wildlife management 
        in a bid to enhance sustainability in the area. The blue duiker was chosen 
        as indicator since it is the most heavily hunted species in the area.</p>
      <h2>Participatory simulation workshops</h2>
      <p>A 3-step exercise was carried out in order to facilitate the comprehension 
        of the computer model among participants. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first step was meant to introduce the abstract representation 
          of a village in the forest and the blue duiker individual-based population 
          module. The different types of land cover and the notion of cell as 
          a 1-ha portion of space were presented, as well as the 7 colors used 
          to represent the various stages of individual blue duikers. </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>In a second step, hunting with traps was introduced in a wider portion 
          of forest (two villages linked by a road, a stylized map still without 
          any realism). </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>The last step was built on the elements previously introduced but 
          was based on an explicit representation of the 7 villages and the Northern 
          periphery of the Korup National Park. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The spatial resolution of the model (the dimension of the smallest observable 
        detail) was the same in the 3 steps: a cell always represents 1 ha. The 
        whole portion of space represented in the model was gradually expanded: 
        1.5 km * 1.5 km in the first step; 5 km * 5 km in the second step; 16 
        km * 18 km in the last step. This process of zooming out allowed starting 
        focusing on the biology and the behavior of the blue duiker. The objective 
        was to communicate and to discuss the related parameters and the underlying 
        assumptions for the participants to not consider the model as a black 
        box and to become familiar with it. In the final step of the workshops, 
        the more realistic representation of the region in the model allowed making 
        the final discussions more concrete. </p>
