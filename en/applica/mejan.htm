      <h2>Pine encroachment of natural ecosystems (Causse Mejan)</h2>

        is a model which simulates contrasting management behaviour in the face 
        of pine encroachment in natural ecosystems with tremendous biological 
        diversity. The three agents (sheep farmers, foresters, and a national 
        park) are involved in the management of land subject to encroachment by 
        <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> and <i>P. nigra</i> with different temporal and 
        spatial scales. All the agents are concerned by this global biological 
        process although it affects their management goals (sheep production, 
        timber production, nature conservation) in very different ways. </p>
      <p>The natural resources are defined by the vegetation types according to 
        the combination of vegetation layers (tree, shrub or grass), the topographic 
        position, land tenure and conservation value (fauna, flora, landscape). 
        The land is represented by a grid made from the rasterization of a real 
        vectorial map. A model incorporates changes in vegetation due to pine 
        encroachment according to trends of natural succession and land or timber 
        management decisions. </p>
      <p>Grazing management strategies are based on the crop/pasture ratio, grazing 
        pressure, distance to housing, and the farmer's environmental awareness. 
        Forest management strategies are related to the status of the forest owner 
        and the legal constraints to afforestation management. National range 
        management focuses on pine destruction according to the land's value -in 
        terms of flora and fauna- and the maintenance of open landscapes. </p>
      <p><img src="/images/applica/testGMG.gif" width="355" height="360"></p>
      <p>The two main goals of the modelling approach are to compare contrasting 
        management scenarios and to allow the agents to exchange their perceptions 
        of the process of pine encroachment. If this approach is successful, it 
        may lead to the development of common land management strategies. The 
        most important original point is that of combining the MAS with a role 
        play with constant feedback between the two. A first MAS is used to represent 
        the system according to the available scientific knowledge of the ecological 
        process and the available information on agents' practices. Then, a simplified 
        version is developed so that the real agents can understand the process 
        and see a common representation of the system. Lastly, the <a href="mejanjeu.htm">simplified 
        MAS is part of a role play</a> used to show how, in a neutral but realistic 
        context, the agents react to likely changes in land dynamics that may 
        occur in the near future. </p>
