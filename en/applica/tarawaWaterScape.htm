      <h1>Tarawa Waterscape Model<br>
         the interconnected impacts of water service delivery<br>
        in a small Pacific town </h1>

	Tarawa Waterscape is a model that simulates the water service delivery in a small town in the country of Kiribati; 
	exploring the inter-connected impacts of land-use, water use, pollution, and water extraction in a distributed fashion. 
	As such it supports negotiation and policy analysis, as a follow up on previous Companion Modelling exercises, i.e. AtollScape, 
	and <a href = "http://cormas.cirad.fr/en/applica/atollGame.htm">AtollGame</a>.</p>
      <p><img src="../../images/applica/TarawaWaterScape-Grid.png" width="185" height="200" align="left">It is built up around the representation of 7 islands within the atoll; where one is the most densely populated island of Betio, 
	two represent the two islands with water reserves and land-ownership disputes from which water is extracted for the purpose 
	of water distribution; and the remaining four islands represent villages that consume distributed water.</p>
      <p>The UML <a href="http://cormas.cirad.fr/images/applica/TarawaWaterScape-CD.jpg" target="_blank">class diagramm</a> shows the overall structure of the model. The most detailed behavioural modules relate to 
		1) the behaviour of the landowners in the disputed water reserves; and how their behaviour impact on the water quality via contamination; 
		and 2) the behaviour of household water users (see UML <a href="http://cormas.cirad.fr/images/applica/TarawaWaterScape-SD.jpg" target="_blank">sequence diagram</a>); 
		and how their behaviour impacts primarily on water balances and health issues. </p>
      <p>The most important natural systems are the flow balances, including hydrological modelling of the freshwater lenses 
	under the water reserves – including consideration of tree coverage; on the basis of rainfall and evaporation patterns specified in input files.</p>
      <p>The main aim of the modelling approach is to identify the inter-connected impacts on various management strategies, 
	such as leakage control, co-management of reserves with landowners, increased utilisation of raintanks or better infrastructure management. 
	As such it can form the basis for negotiation between the range of stakeholders that are involved in the management of the water delivery system, 
	including various government departments, the local water utility, as well as community members and landowners.</p>
