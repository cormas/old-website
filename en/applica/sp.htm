        is a model that simulates contrasting negotiation strategies for setting 
        up a sylvopastoral management plan to prevent large forest fires in Mediterranean 
        forests. It is built up around a virtual forest landscape and the management 
        rules governing two agents (a sheep farmer and a forester) who are confronted 
        by the same problem but have different goals (sheep production, biodiversity, 
        and landscape protection). </p>
      <p>The natural resources are defined by combining layers of vegetation (tree, 
        shrub or grass) randomly. They are subject to the rules of biological 
        dynamics according to management, natural succession patterns, and forest 
        fire. Grazing management strategies are based on forage availability which 
        depends on climate and the vegetation's structure and pattern. Forest 
        management strategies are based on fire prevention (prevailing wind direction, 
        the combustibility of plant structures), the value of forest timber, and 
        landscape diversity. The number of operations carried out by each agent 
        depends on cash availability. </p>
      <p>The main aim of the modelling approach is to identify which structure 
        and pattern of vegetation is most effective in terms of the main management 
        objectives and to compare several negotiation strategies between the two 
        agents. The simplified fire propagation model provided in the MAS can 
        also be used to test the efficiency of the sylvopastoral management plan 
        in terms of the frequency of fire or the project's progress. The model 
        may also be applied to identify potential equilibrium states and to compare 
        the ways foresters and shepherds share information. </p>
      <p>The MAS has the advantage of being linked to a <a href="spjeu.htm">role 
        play</a> in which the players' behaviour is observed and analysed so that 
        new options for negotiation strategies between the agents can be coded.
