      <h1>ABSTRACT (Agent Based Simulation Tool for Resource Allocation in a CatchmenT)</h1>
      <h1><font size="3">P. van Oel</font></h1>
      <p><img src="../../images/applica/ABSTRACT-map.jpg" width="593" height="343" align="right">With 
        the ABSTRACT model the effect of rainfall patterns and water management 
        interventions on spatiotemporal distribution of water resources availability 
        and use in a catchment can be evaluated. The model is designed for basins 
        with dams for water storage that serve a large irrigation sector. The 
        model may be used to explore possibilities of multi-annual water allocation. 
      </p>
      <p>Freshwater in a river basin is a common-pool resource (CPR) which is, 
        because of the nature of a river basin, asymmetric (Van Oel et al., 2009). 
        For a river basin which contains many water reservoirs one cannot speak 
        of a single resource stock, as is the case for an irrigation scheme with 
        one central reservoir. A river basin with multiple reservoirs is therefore 
        fundamentally different from a canal-irrigation system and should rather 
        be regarded as a system of nested or connected CPR's. Conflicts of interest 
        may exist at and between different levels on the river basin scale: <br>
        &quot; the local level (e.g. conflicts between individual water users 
        around a local resource)<br>
        &quot; the sub basin level (e.g. conflicts between groups of users using 
        different local water sources)<br>
        &quot; the basin level (e.g. conflicts between equitability and efficiency)</p>
      <p>A first application of the model has been implemented using survey data 
        on farmers' preferred land use in case of different water availability 
        situations at the sub basin level of the Jaguaribe basin in Brazil (<a href="../../images/applica/ABSTRACT-1.jpg" target="_blank">figure 
        1</a>; <a href="../../images/applica/ABSTRACT-2.jpg" target="_blank">figure 
        2</a>; Van Oel, 2009; Van Oel et al., 2010). Currently we are working 
        on modifying the model for studying basin closure and the effects of decentralization 
        of water allocation management at the basin level.</p>
      <p>Model output includes water availability and water use at levels ranging 
        from local to the (sub) basin level. Model validation was partly done 
        using land use classifications from remotely-sensed data (<a href="../../images/applica/ABSTRACT-3.jpg" target="_blank">figure 
        3</a>) and is described in detail in Van Oel et al. (2010).<br>
