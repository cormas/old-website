      <h2>Emergence of Resource-Sharing Conventions</h2>

      <p>In his article entitled "Spontaneous order", Sugden (1989) analyses the 
        conditions under which collective rules regulating access to a natural 
        resource can evolve and maintain themselves without conscious design, 
        and without external enforcement. The author adopts a critical perspective 
        with respect to classical game-theoretic approaches to this issue. According 
        to Sugden, the problem of access rules is a typical case of co-ordination 
        games with more than one uniquely rational outcome, with the ensuing difficulties 
        for classical game-theory in predicting which outcome may obtain: agents 
        following a particular rule will be guided by something more than the 
        axioms of rational choice as normally understood by economists.</p>
      <p>As an illustration, he cites the example of a self-enforcing resource-sharing 
        arrangement on the coast of Yorkshire, in England, where people compete 
        for the gathering of driftwood brought to the shore by storms. The arrangement, 
        he stresses, can be looked at from the perspective of its efficiency properties. 
        The allocation of a stretch of the shoreline to the first who gets there 
        avoids the allocation of too much labour to the wood collection activity; 
        the ownership rights to properly marked wood piles avoids people having 
        to monitor and protect their piles. In effect, the arrangement thus enhances 
        the efficiency of driftwood collection, relatively to a free-for-all situation.</p>
      <p>Sugden is interested in the processes leading to the emergence of such 
        conventions in a collective, without recurring to the hypothesis of an 
        external, over-arching, agent capable of enforcing a particular rule. 
        He focuses his analysis on the process by which conventions evolve in 
        a collective, raising the questions of (i) how a convention starts to 
        evolve, i.e. significantly more people follow it than follow any other 
        convention; and (ii) what self-reinforcing processes lead the convention 
        to become established in the collective. Sugden analyses various factors 
        which may help to respond to these two questions, including the prominence 
        of certain forms of co-ordination and the role of common experience in 
        this respect, as well as the versatility of particular conventions.</p>
      <p>We tried to build an agent-based simulation model for the analysis of 
        these questions. Agent-based modelling of social phenomena has developed 
        rapidly in recent years. The approach appears particularly well-suited 
        to the type of issues considered by Sugden. It allows to tackle explicitly 
        questions of process and emergence in the economy, which have presented 
        difficulties to traditional modelling in economics. In particular, it 
        allows the explicit representation of a heterogeneous collective of agents 
        of variable sizes, and the analysis of its evolution at both individual 
        and collective levels.</p>
      <p>The model has three main components: 1. a spatial grid ("the beach"); 
        2. a passive object ("driftwood") which is distributed in the grid, any 
        single cell having the capacity to store an unlimited number of pieces 
        of wood; 3. social agents ("driftwood collectors") having the capacity 
        to move over the spatial grid, and to collect driftwood.</p>
      <p>The emphasis is on simulating various processes by which the convention 
        regarding the property of marked wood-piles could become established in 
        this metaphorical model. The main focus is on strategies of avoidance 
        of wood piles, and their diffusion in the collective. For this reason, 
        relatively little use is made here of the rules regarding collection behaviour 
        and the resolution of conflicts, other than as a means to allocate wood 
        where these conflicts occur (following the principles described above). 
        In this, the analysis presented here departs from Sugden's article. A 
        further step in the use of the model would be to grant more attention 
        to the way in which agents decide of the strategy to adopt in case of 
        conflict, depending on their experience of past interactions with others, 
        an issue to which this author devotes special attention.</p>
      <p>With our model, various scenarios were simulated and two general mechanisms 
        were analysed, with variants in their definition: (i) peer pressure as 
        a control on individual behaviour; (ii) imitation as a determinant of 
        individual strategies. </p>
