              is a game where up to 9 players take the role of a forestry or              mining company. Players must try to make their company prosper              while taking into account the environmental and societal impacts              of their activities. To develop their strategy, players can              negotiate with each other. For their actions, they own a small set              of tokens that they can place on the board:</p>            <ul>              <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Road segments that open access to new game                cell. The more roads there are on a cell, the more trucks can                circulate and the more people can settle.</li>              <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trucks are placed on the roads so that they                can harvest wood or iron resources. There are two types of                trucks that differ only in their transport capacity and rental                costs.</li>              <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plantation tokens enable rapid regrowth of                the forest.</li>              <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guard tokens prevent migrating populations                from using or settling on the roads. They can also expulse the                population if the player wants to.</li>              <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mine tokens must be placed on a cell                with no population.

They are affected by the state of the                forests in their cell.

              board represents a forest basin. It is divided into cells whose              color depends on the state of the forest (from dark green for a              very good state, to yellow for fragmented and degraded forests). A              set of 9 forest cells constitutes a forest concession in which a              player can exploit the resources. Forest concessions are sold in              an auction at the beginning of the game. Mining concessions only              appear during the game: players choose when they can enter the              game. A mining concession can only be placed on a cell where there              is an iron deposit, their size varies between 1 and 3 cells.              Finally, two city cells are located at the edges of the board.              These cells are connected to only one other cell of the forest              board. The cities are the departure point for the migrating              populations and the arrival point for the trucks to sell and              unload their merchandise. </p>            <img src="../../images/applica/mineset_Grid.jpg" alt="MineSet Grid on Cormas"              title="MineSet Grid on Cormas"              style="width: 665px; height: 554px;"><br>            <address>&nbsp; The MineSet board under Cormas</address>            <address> </address>            <p class="Standard" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">The
              game takes place over a total of 5 time steps, each representing              10 years. At the beginning of their turn, players must converse              and organize themselves to lay down their tokens or exchange parts              of concessions. They can also set up an agreement between them              that, in exchange for a certain respect for the environment, gives              access to a more lucrative market.</p>            <img src="../../images/applica/mineset_Probes.jpg" alt="Quelques indicateurs du jeu"              title="Quelques indicateurs du jeu"              style="width: 789px; height: 226px;"><br>            <address>&nbsp; Evolution of some indicators (global on the left,              individual on the right)</address>            <h2>A hybrid game</h2>            <div class="page" title="Page 8">              <div class="layoutArea">                <div class="column">                  <p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'LiberationSerif'">With
                      MineSet, it is possible to move away from the interactive                      game in order to explore strategies. Thus, a MineSet                      simulation can be autonomous, just like a classic                      simulation. This option also allows participants to play                      MineSet even if there are missing players. In this case,                      the missing players are replaced by autonomous agents.                      This is a true hybrid simulation in the sense of Le Page                      et al (2010). Thus, after specifying the number of                      players, MineSet opens an initialization interface where                      each player chooses his name, the type of company he wants                      to manage and a color </span><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'LiberationSerif'">:<br>                    </span></p>                  <img src="../../images/applica/mineset_Init.jpg" alt="Initialization interface"                    title="Initialization interface"                    style="width: 431px; height: 520px;"></div>                <div class="column">                  <address>&nbsp;&nbsp; MineSet initialization interface</address>                  <address> </address>                </div>              </div>            </div>            <div class="page" title="Page 16">              <div class="layoutArea">                <div class="column">                  <p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'LiberationSerif'">To

                        "Profit" strategy, which aims to set up as many trucks                        as possible in order to harvest as many resources as                        possible. Focused only on its own profit, it has no                        consideration for environmental aspects. It is a short                        and medium term strategy with, at best, the implantation                        of plantations to produce a maximum of wood. It is also                        a strategy that invests heavily at the beginning of the                        game to acquire a concession that is easily accessible                        from a city and that allows borrowing to make large                        investments quickly.</span></li>                    <li><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'LiberationSerif'">The
                        "ProEnvironment" strategy manages its concession by                        trying to protect the forest as much as possible. To do                        this, it will not exploit some of the cells in its                        concession at all. In addition, it prevents populations                        that could degrade the forest from settling in its                        concession. Secondly, this strategy aims at taking only                        a limited quantity of wood which will regenerate during                        the turn. The company thus carries out rather small                        harvests. Finally, it takes the risk of investing at the                        beginning of the game to obtain a central concession in                        order to protect the environment as much as possible                        from other players.</span></li>                    <li><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'LiberationSerif'">The
                        "Passive" strategy manages its concession by minimizing                        the number of actions. Unlike the other two, this                        strategy aims to reduce its risks and invests as little                        as possible. It is also a hybrid strategy between                        environmental protection and personal profit. To do                        this, it sets up a rotation to exploit the cells in its                        concession. To protect the environment, a small part of                        her concession is not exploited. On the other hand, she                        does not prevent populations from settling on the                        concession.</span></li>                  </ol>                </div>              </div>            </div>            <img src="../../images/applica/3p3p3p.gif" alt="Animated GIF" title="Model dynamic"><br>            <address>Example of a simulation with 9 autonomous agents divided              into 3 "Profit", 3 ProEnvironment" and 3 "Passive" strategies</address>            <br>            For a more detailed description, download Anton Bommel's <a href="../../pdf/MineSetReport-EN.pdf">dissertation</a>            (translated in English).<br>            <br>            <!--EndFragment-->            <ul>              <li>Download the <a href="../../logiciel/Mineset.zip">model</a>                (zipfile, 88Ko, Cormas 2021)<br>                For more information, contact the <a href="mailto:anton.bommel@supagro.fr">aut<span                    style="color: black;">hors</span></a>.              </li>            </ul>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <!--#include virtual="/include/copyright_en.inc" --> </td>          <td width="15" valign="top" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"> <br>          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </body></html>
