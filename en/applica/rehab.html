The <b>landscape</b> is            also a nesting and breeding ground for a protected migratory <i>Bird</i>.&nbsp;
            The <i>Rangers</i>’ task is to maximize Bird reproduction by            creating protected areas, while Harvesters have to collect <i>Biomass</i>,            their only source of income. Rules about biomass regeneration,            distribution amongst harvesters, and bird reproduction are not            disclosed to the players. A typical <b>game session</b> includes            two successive <b>scenarios</b>: without communication between            players then with communication. A final collective <b>debriefing</b>            brings out the level of understanding of the hidden rules, the            individual and collective strategies and how these influenced the            game's outcomes. <br>            <br>            In most cases <b>communication</b> improves the outcomes for both            roles, <i>Harvesters</i> and <i>Rangers</i>, even though players            construct and articulate rational decisions based on limited or even            flawed understandings of the rules. This suggests that, in the            absence of enforcement mechanisms, <b>trust</b> and <b>communication</b>            prevail over knowledge and understanding when it comes to managing            natural resources and resolving <b>trade-offs</b> between            conservation and development. <br>            <img src="../../images/applica/rehab-b2.jpg" alt="A game session with children"              title="A game session with children"              style="width: 535px; height: 319px;">            <h3>Description and specificity</h3>            The game board is composed of 20 cells, each with a biomass level            between 0 and 3. It is this biomass that the harvesters must collect            to survive.<br>            <img src="../../images/applica/rehab.-d.png" title="board game" style="width: 361px; height: 283px;"><br>            In addition, this area is home to an endangered migratory bird            species. Birds move to nesting sites each season. Suitable nesting            sites must contain sufficient biomass (level &gt; 1). Breeding is            successful (1 or 2 chicks) as long as nesting boxes (and their            vicinity) are not disturbed by harvesters.<br>            The dynamics of the biomass evolves according to the following            rules:<br>            <img src="../../images/applica/rehab-ST-en.png" alt="State-Transition Diag."              title="State-Transition Diag."              style="width: 861px; height: 430px;"><br>            <br>            <!--EndFragment-->            <ul>            </ul>            The material needed to organize a gaming session is available for            free            <ul>              <li>Get the software ready to use on your laptop: a Windows                computer, unzip&nbsp; <a href="../../logiciel/ReHab-exe.zip">ReHab-exe.zip</a>&nbsp;
