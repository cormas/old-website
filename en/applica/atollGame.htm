      <h1>AtollGame, a computer-assisted role playing game <br>
        supporting equitable groundwater management <br>
        in Tarawa atoll (Republic of Kiribati) </h1>
      <h1><font size="3">A. Dray, P. Perez, P. D'Aquino</font></h1>
      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <p><img src="../../images/applica/atollGame.jpg" width="252" height="191" align="right">AtollGame 
        was designed and implemented within the framework of the Companion Modelling 
        Approach (ComMod). The game aims at providing information about the complexity 
        of interactions at stake dealing with groundwater management in a small 
        but nonetheless overcrowded atoll in Micronesia. The game also aims at 
        enhancing communication between stakeholders with conflicting views since 
        local interests based on customary rules seldom match public interest 
        officially represented by Government institutions (landownership, water 
        rights, environmental risk). The final goal was to support the eventual 
        willingness of the different parties to explore new management scenarios 
        to reach a collective agreement on equitable management of groundwater 
        on Tarawa and to secure the long-term sustainability.</p>
      <h2>Description of the game</h2>
      <p>The set of the game is composed of two identical virtual islands with 
        simplified shapes and dimensions. One island is sparsely populated with 
        freshwater available, the other one is overcrowded with already polluted 
        groundwater. Information available on the boards is: the land tenure, 
        the pumping sites and the water distribution system. An Agent Based Model 
        (ABM) of the game taking charge of biophysical processes is run during 
        the playing sessions. It provides indicators dealing with climatic hazard, 
        lens salinity and lens pollution.</p>
      <p>8 players are allocated on each island and take the role of landowner 
        and head of family. Players' profile includes job, number of members in 
        his household, water needs and equipments. Players' objective is to provide 
        enough drinking water (quality and quantity) to his family by investing 
        into new water equipments according to their income. Players also have 
        to accommodate new relatives on their land. </p>
      <p>The game is divided into 2 sets of 3 rounds. Each round represents a 
        one-year period. The first set is dedicated to individual strategies, 
        the second set to collective rules. An important debriefing stage is then 
        dedicated to collective analysis of the situation and proposals for new 
        scenarios. The game being flexing enough, emerging individual strategies 
        (loan bargaining, importing high quality filters) demonstrated the ability 
        of the players to innovate and interact during the game.</p>
      <h2>Use of the game</h2>
      <p>The game has been played once during a 2-day workshop involving 18 participants 
        and gathering representatives from Government agencies and local communities. 
        Although game sessions delivered successful outcomes, the final stage 
        of the project is characterised by the upheaval of contradictory Government 
        stands that undermine the whole process.</p>
      <h2>Software</h2>
      <p>You can <a href="/logiciels/atoll.zip">download</a> the Cormas model 
        source code and the model documentation (as a set of UML diagrams). </p>
