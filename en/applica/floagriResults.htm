      <p>Each agent owns a single lot of 100 ha and it is not allowed to move to another farm nor to expand by buying new lots. Each lot has a similar vegetation cover. The agents vary only  on their specific  activities (FM, PFAC and/or LR compliance). For standard  simulations, each family has 3 workers and 3 children. It starts with 7  200 R$ (members &times; initial cash/person = 6 &times; 1 200 R$) and 468 available workdays (workers &times; work days per season = 3&times;156). In its standard version, the model is deterministic: no randomness is involved during the  simulations. Thus, from a given initial state, it will always produce the same  output for each strategy (Note that a stochastic version  -with randomness- will be used in the analysis in order to test the impact of  sickness probability or when specifying a new initial land cover).      </p>

      <h5><em>Fig. 1: Example of land cover evolution for a standard simulation for 6 different farms </em></h5>
      <p>Starting from the same state, the land  cover at the end of a simulation (40 years) is quite different depending on the  performed scenario. After 12 years, the conventional breeder (<em>StandStrat</em>) for example has converted  all his land into pasture (this period is called installation phase). In  contrast, the agents in charge of FM as well as the agents who  are artificially obliged to respect the law, have maintained their LR (80 ha).  Their installation phase is much shorter (5 years).<strong> </strong></p>
      <p>By looking at the agents&rsquo; incomes, as noticed previously,  the output data cannot be rigorously compared with real incomes as the agents keep  their standard of living whatever their savings. What is more relevant is to  compare the economic results between the agents in order to rank the incomes&rsquo;  levels according to the scenarios.
</p>
      <h2><a>Scenarios results</a></h2>
      <h3>The impacts of FM and PFAC for agents respecting their Legal Reserve </h3>
      <p>Given the fact that the agents <em>FmStrat</em>, <em>Fm+Pfac</em>, <em>StandLR</em> and <em>PfacLR</em> do all respect their LR, the  efficiencies are compared on the same area available to cultivate (20 ha). <strong></strong>Indeed, at the end of the third year, each agent  has deforested his authorized surface. The rest remains forest and only the  agents <em>FmStrat</em> and <em>Fm+Pfac</em> can use it to harvest timber  during the FM cycles.
      </p>

      <h5><em>Fig. 2: Evolution of the  annual incomes of 4 agents respecting their LR, during a standard simulation of  40 years.</em></h5>
      <p>The standard breeder  obliged to preserve his LR (<em>StandLR</em>)  without any alternative activity, has an averaged income of 13 000 R$/year for  three workers (calculated from year 10 to 40, i.e. after the installation phase),  that is below the minimum salary (the Brazilian minimum salary in 2009 was 465  R$/month, see Portalbrasil, 2009).  During the 5 first years, the family revenues originate mainly from  annual crops production and from timber sales when converting forest into  pasture. During this installation phase, the smallholder invests intensively in  livestock by buying cows and implanting new pastures. When the authorized 20 ha  are fully covered with pasture and because the smallholder cannot buy new land,  he manages his herd and sells out the remaining available working days of the  household. The regular fluctuations of the livestock income are due to the sale  of the cull cows and the purchase of heifer calves.<br>
FM increases the incomes of agents <em>FmStrat</em> and <em>Fm+Pfac</em> every 30 years. The first growth peak is smaller than the  second one because the agents invest in livestock: while implanting new  pastures and buying many cows, they transfer a high part of the first FM profits  into livestock capital.<br>
Between the timber&rsquo;s harvesting periods, incomes  of agents <em>FmStrat</em> and <em>Fm+Pfac</em> drop to a value closed to that  of agent <em>StandLR</em>. Nevertheless, even  during this forest regeneration phase, FM has a positive effect: mean income during  the renewal phase is approximately 365 R$/month/worker for <em>StandLR</em>, while it reaches 556 R$/month/worker for <em>FmStrat</em> and <em>Fm+Pfac</em>, which is 52% better. Such difference is linked with  livestock and pasture quality: short of savings, agent <em>StandLR</em> does not succeed in maintaining all the pastures and the cattle  that gradually degrade and as a result, become less productive  (eq. 1). Thus, the mean monthly income of livestock for agent <em>StandLR</em> is 344 R$ when it is more  than twice better (797 R$) for agent <em>FmStrat</em>.  In this scenario, FM incomes provide some financial resources allowing the  smallholder to maintain the productivity of livestock and pasture.</p>
      <p>Agent <em>PfacLR</em> starting phase (10 first years) is as difficult as that of agent <em>StandLR</em>. But, by adopting permanent  crops, this agent succeeds in gradually recovering the degraded pastures and thus  is able to reach higher cattle productivity. This agent also increases the  household incomes by harvesting permanent crops. In counterpart, as PFAC needs  more labor for implantation and maintenance, the agent sells fewer working days.  Nevertheless, after 12 years, the annual income becomes higher than that of <em>StandLR</em>, and it is equivalent to <em>FmStrat</em> and <em>Fm+Pfac</em> after 20 years. PFAC provides positive effects on family&rsquo;s  income but at mid-term (15 years). </p>
      <p>The following diagram shows the annual incomes  of the agents according to the structure of the family. The same former simulations  have been run but for a family of 8 members with successively 1 to 8 workers. </p>
      <p><img src="floagri/result2.gif" width="398" height="271" alt="results 2"></p>
      <h5><em>Fig. 3: Annual incomes of the  agents according to the number of workers</em>. </h5>
      <p>Not surprisingly, whatever the agent strategy, annual income increases as the family has more workers. This increase is mostly  due to higher number of working days available to be sold. However, for the  breeders who do not perform FM (agents <em>StandLR</em> and <em>PfacLR</em>), an income shift is  observed when the workers are more than four: above this number, the family is  able to maintain and clean up all its pastures, thus the difference of annual  income with agents performing FM is low and solely due to the timber harvest  peaks. Below four workers, the family lacks labor force to maintain all its  crops and pastures which productivity decreases. We can thus conclude that,<strong> </strong>when subcontracted, FM is mainly  useful for families with few workers as it helps to compensate the lack of  manpower.<strong> </strong></p>
      <h3><a> The cost of staying into legality</a></h3>
      <p>This  section assesses the cost of staying into the legality by preserving the LR. As stated by the old Forest Code but also by  the new code in some sensitive areas, the law required the landowners in the  Amazon to conserve 80% of the farmland in forest. The following simulations  compare agents that respect their LR (agents <em>FmStrat</em>, <em>Fm+Pfac</em> and <em>StandLR</em>) with those who do not (<em>StandStrat</em> and <em>PfacStrat</em>). Figure  4 shows the evolution of the agents&rsquo; annual  income. The installation phase (time to cut off the forest) is  much longer for agents <em>StandStrat</em> and <em>PfacStrat</em> (12 years) whereas  it is 5 years for agents <em>FmStrat</em>, D, <em>StandLR</em>, <em>PfacLR</em>. During this phase, they face low income  (short farm production and investment in livestock). But after this period,  when they have completely turned their farm into pasture, agents <em>StandStrat</em> and <em>PfacStrat</em> succeed in increasing their savings more  rapidly than the other agents who kept their LR. Such shift is linked  with the livestock incomes on 100 ha instead of 20 ha that do not require much  manpower for its maintenance (300 working days/year for 100 ha of pastures with  cattle). </p>
      <p><img src="floagri/result3.gif" width="468" height="253" alt="results 3"></p>
      <h5>Fig. 4: <em>Evolution of the annual  incomes during a standard simulation of 40 years, according to the 4 agent  types </em></h5>
      <p>When the standard breeder get 100 ha of  pastures and because he cannot buy new land, his activity consists mainly in  managing his herd then selling the extra labor force. For these specific  simulations, FM does not compensate the breeding loose due to pasture  limitation. Excluding the installation phase, the monthly income of agent <em>StandStrat</em> is about 4 250 R$, whereas it  is only 1 670 R$ for a breeder doing FM, i.e. 60 % lower.<br>
Agent <em>PfacStrat</em> has similar results than <em>StandStrat</em>. As  he needs more manpower to implant and maintain PFAC, his income is a little lower  than agent <em>StandStrat</em>&rsquo;s. Unlike agent <em>PfacLR</em> on 20 ha, PFAC has no positive  effect when using the 100 ha, even after a long period.</p>
      <p>The new Brazilian Forestry Code allows, in  certain zones (consolidated zones, defined by the ZEE plan), to use and  deforest until 50% of the farm: </p>
      <p><img src="floagri/result4.gif" width="537" height="321" alt="results 4"></p>
      <h5><em>Fig. 5: The annual incomes of  the agents when LR is set to 50%. </em></h5>
      <p>When authorized to cultivate half of their  lot, <em>StandStrat</em> and <em>PfacStrat</em> have the same incomes than  previously (obviously, because they do not care about LR). But a change of LR  ratio increases the monthly incomes of the agents that keep their LR: from 1 090  to 2 500 R$ for agent <em>StandLR</em> (+ 130 %);  3 035 R$ (+81 %) and 2 680 R$ (+74 %) for <em>FmStrat</em> and <em>Fm+Pfac</em>. Compared to agent <em>StandLR</em>, the FM has lower impact on  incomes, except for the first years of installation.<br>
      Thus, economically speaking, a reduction of  LR to 50% would better help the small farmers than applying FM on 80 ha. On the  other hand, if LR were complied (that is seldom the case), it would decrease  the forest size from 80% to 50 %.</p>
      <h3>Portion of property initially deforested</h3>
      <p>To ensure a good understanding of the  model, it is also necessary to initialize the simulations from initial states  with less virgin forest, as it is the case nowadays for a majority of smallholders  in Par&aacute; and Mato Grosso. Modifying the initial deforestation part, from 0% to  100%, has resulted in the following output. For each new initial state of the  farms, deforested plots are randomly covered by annual crop, pasture or fallow,  with a random degradation level. In the cases where the deforestation is greater  than the authorized portion (20%), the agents that respect the law (FM and LR  strategies) will not use a part of their land (covered by fallows and old crops)  so that forests can regenerate. But, as forest regeneration is a very slow  process, the simulations show the full restoration of the LR after a long  period (about 38 years according to initial degradation level). In that case,  the agents undertaking FM can harvest timber even if their forests are below 80  ha (which is something that is not authorized in practice). For each value of  the initial deforestation portion parameter, 100 simulations are repeated in  order to normalize the effect of the randomness.</p>
      <p><img src="floagri/result5.gif" width="441" height="290" alt="results 5"></p>
      <h5><em>Fig. 6: Mean annual incomes  according to initial deforestation.</em></h5>
      <p>The analysis shows that the incomes of the  agents <em>StandStrat</em> and <em>PfacStrat</em>, who do not respect the LR constraints,  decrease rapidly with the initial degradation rate. This is because the farmer  spends time and money to maintain degraded pastures that are basically  unprofitable owing to their poor productivity. As the beginning of the  settlement is very sensitive, loosing time and money for land recuperation  during the first stage holds back the development of the agents. When 40% of the  farm is deforested, the standard breeder has the same income than <em>StandLR</em>, i.e. he is mainly a farm  laborer. <br>
        For the agent <em>FmStrat</em>, in addition to spend energy to maintain unprofitable  pastures on 20 ha, the lack of preserved forest reduces the FM profits and has  more negative effect on the incomes compared to <em>Fm+Pfac</em>, <em>StandLR</em> and <em>PfacLR</em>.<br>
      The signatures of the agents doing PFAC (<em>PfacStrat</em>, <em>Fm+Pfac</em>, <em>PfacLR</em>) are dissimilar: <em>Fm+Pfac</em> and <em>PfacLR</em> that work on 20 ha are not affected by this parameter.  Because they do not spend much in livestock, they are able to recover their  degraded pastures and manage a small area whatever the initial degradation  level. <em>Fm+Pfac</em> has the best income  when initial deforestation is higher than 25%. On the opposite, <em>PfacStrat</em> has bad resistance to initial  degradation, mainly for low deforestation rate. This is because he spends a lot  of energy to implant permanent crops while investing at the same time in  livestock and expanding on the forest. So, when starting from degraded land, PFCA  presents positive effects but solely when the farmer does not invest heavily in  livestock at the same time. Depending on the degraded surface, the period to  get PFAC positive effects can be long. By comparing for example the dynamics of <em>StandStrat</em> and <em>PfacStrat</em> from a 20% degraded farm, the mean income of <em>StandStrat</em> over the 40 years&rsquo; simulation  is higher than of <em>PfacStrat</em>. But <em>PfacStrat</em> has much better incomes solely  after a long period (20 years, not visible on figure 6).        </p>
      <h3>FM, PFAC and resilience &nbsp;</h3>
      <p>Analyzing the effect of hazard on  smallholders is important since the family workforce plays a key role for the household  strategies. For the previous analysis, the sickness probability was set to zero  but the available statistics show that, in the Amazonian pioneer fronts, hazard  is greater and the risk of becoming seriously ill or being injured is higher  than elsewhere. With this regard, IBGE (2008) estimates that a person stays in  hospital once every 10 years (5 % /season/person). <br>
        For the current analysis, the sickness option  has been activated. In the next graph, the sickness probability has been tested  from 0% to 12% per season (analyzing upper probability is not useful since the  available labor force is almost zero). At each season, every member of the  family has a random chance to be sick and to be unable to work during this  time. Due to stochastic events, the simulations are repeated 100 times for each  parameter new value.</p>
      <p><img src="floagri/result6.gif" width="429" height="290" alt="results 6"></p>
      <h5><em>Fig.7: Annual incomes of the  agents according to sick probability per member. 0.05 is the standard risk from  literature.</em></h5>
      <p>Obviously,  all the agents loose income at the extent that hazard risks increase. Interestingly,  agents <em>StandStrat</em> and <em>PfacStrat</em> that do not respect their LR are  more sensitive to hazard. They can hardly expand and maintain their pastures  and cattle when they lose manpower. In contrast, agents managing their forests  (<em>FmStrat</em> and <em>Fm+Pfac</em>) tend to be more resistant to hazards. This because of the extra  revenues originated from FM that make them much less affected by a temporary  loss of labor. As PFAC requires additional investments in money and manpower, <em>PfacStrat</em> and <em>PfacLR</em> are more sensitive to hazards. FM compensates this  sensitivity in the case of agent <em>Fm+Pfac</em>. Figure 8 shows  the distribution of incomes when hazard probability is set to its standard  value (5 % per season/person). In addition, it compares  the effect of LR authorized level for the two scenarios 80 % and 50 %.

      <p><img src="floagri/result7.gif" width="743" height="289" alt="results 7"></p>
      <h5><em>Fig. 8: Annual incomes  when LR is set to 50% or 80%, with 5% risk probability. Sorted distribution of  the incomes for each simulation (left chart). Averaged  incomes over 100 simulations and standard deviation (right chart).</em></h5>
<p>The bar chart (right) presents the averaged  income over the 100 simulations of each agent. The agents <em>StandStrat</em>, <em>FmStratLR:  50%</em> and <em>Fm+PfacLR: 50%</em> have similar mean incomes (about 30 000 R$/year). But the standard  deviations are quite different: <em>StandStrat</em> has irregular incomes when <em>FmStrat</em> and <em>Fm+Pfac</em> are much more regular. This  irregularity of incomes is more visible on the left chart: here, each point is  the annual income of an agent for one simulation. By sorting these values for  100 simulations, the curves show how these incomes are distributed. For standard  breeder exploiting 100 ha, the chances to succeed are spread from highest to  lowest incomes (high variance): in more than 20 % of the simulations, StandStrat  fails to manage his farm. When an accident or a disease occurs in the  installation phase, the consequences strongly impact this agent&rsquo;s economic  situation and his farm productivity. The agent is more able to resist to hazards  when his expansion phase is complete. These results are worst for agent PfacStrat  who fails in 60% of the cases: this agent is more sensitive to hazard during  installation phase. As PFAC needs investments, it is only profitable in the  long term when the family is strongly installed. </p>
In contrast, agents FmStrat and Fm+Pfac who  manage their forest, have very stable incomes. Even when a family member is  unable to work, the quality of the farm production is such that the family can  better resist to temporary lower labor force. When the LR is set to 50 ha,  their mean income is equal to that of StandStrat, but with low fluctuations  (over 100 repetitions).
<h2><a> Discussion</a> <a>: Optimal conditions versus hazard and  degraded lands</a> </h2>
<p>As stated by K. Popper for theories, a model cannot be validated in the sense of having a complete  confidence on its outputs. Like theories, a simulation model is inherently  wrong: sometimes it can be corroborated by data but in most cases, it is  refuted by empirical observations. Comparing  the model outputs with data does not authorize to conclude its definitive validation; it is just a way to  increase the likelihood of its results. As the alternative practices developed in the FloAgri project are  recent and not broadly used in the Amazon, it is also hard to compare the model  outputs with real data. But, while the lack of historical data prevents us to &ldquo;validate&rdquo;  the model, its dynamics are coherent with observations and expert knowledge. Instead of comparing static data on each  practice independently (performing a cost/production comparison is quite  simple), the ABM helps to understand how various activities can interact. It  helps to explain why, depending on the context, some practices can be efficient  or either fail. Of course, it should be interesting to compare our results with an  optimization model that aims in determining the best mixture of land use  patterns. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that our ABM does not seek to  optimize the land use distribution. Since it focuses on the behavior of agents  in a temporal dimension, it helps us understand the reasons for success or failure  of a strategy in various situations.<br>
  Our results show that without any  agricultural alternative, a small breeder compliant with LR has low income that  comes mainly from the sale of his labor force. <em>StandStrat</em> change from 80% to 50% of LR would obviously help him in  improving his living conditions.<br>
  The model shows that FM and PFAC are not  miraculous solutions allowing a small holder to prosper while preserving his  LR. Compared to a standard breeder artificially restricted on 20 ha (<em>StandLR</em>), the adoption of alternative  practices can increase his income (twice his standard income in the best case). But what he earns from 20 ha of crops and  pastures, plus the revenue he obtains occasionally from FM, remain lower than  the income he gets from 100 ha of pasture. <br>
  The additional practices, however, may have  positive effects when various types of hazard are introduced in the model. For  example, the standard breeders are more sensible to sick probability than the  agents performing FM. As the risk of being seriously sick or wound is higher in  the Amazon, FM increases the resilience to hazards. The additional revenue generated by FM appears useful when the labor force is reduced because it helps in  investing in productive livestock that do not require a lot of work. <br>
  PFAC has positive effects when a reasonable  part of the farm is degraded. By using no-till techniques, it allows recovering  some productive pastures when standard breeder can just maintain poorly  profitable cattle. But PFAC is a risky activity because no-till farming needs  competences, manpower and financial investment. The model shows that PFAC  weakens the farmers when they are in installation phase: they cannot invest in such  technique and livestock at once. By gradually recovering degraded pastures, PFAC  can be seen as an intensification practice that improves cattle productivity on  the long term.<br>
  As a result, when starting from a degraded  farm and when taking into account hazard probabilities, the FM may offer  equivalent mean income than for unrestricted standard breeder, but with higher  stability. Finally,  coupling FM and PFAC seems to be an interesting alternative that might make the  farmers more resistant to hazards with higher income, while at the same time preserving  the major part of their forest.</p>
<h2><a>Conclusion</a> </h2>
<p>By implementing agricultural activities  related to standard or specific strategies, an ABM offers the advantage of  explaining how several actions  can complement or compete. In contrast, a simple comparison of static economic  returns between different activities  does not inform about such complementarities. By targeting the model on the management of the labor force,  the simulations allow us to explain how some  actions may affect the achievement of  others. Thus, our ABM helps to understand why some alternative  practices can be efficient or either fail, depending on the context. <br>
  As several studies have already pointed out,  succeeding in making small-scale forest management plan financially viable in  the Amazon region remains a challenge and many barriers have still to be  removed (Hajjar et al  2011, Drigo and al. 2012). It is considered relatively risky  in the short-term to invest in forest management whereas investing in cattle is  often considered as a safety option, at least in the short-term. The latter situation  may inverse in the long-term related to efforts to decrease the many barriers  threatening the long-term viability of forest management (Drigo and al. 2012). <br>
  However,  standard breeding, which is the most common production system among  smallholders in the Amazon, is also risky during the installation phase. When  taking into account the current available cash and manpower of a family, our  ABM shows that a breeder quickly meets difficulties that prevent him from  developing as it would do under optimal conditions. The model reveals that the  agents that prefer to pursue ranching activities by converting all their land  to pasture, are economically vulnerable at the beginning and they can easily fail  due to increasing risk and land degradation. <br>
  In  contrast, the agents who are able to manage their forests tend to strengthen their resilience capacities against hazards mainly when  considering sickness probability. When subcontracted, the FM cannot improve  much the mean annual income of smallholders in the Amazon but it tends to stabilize  this income and improves the household resilience in the long-term by helping to  maintain pastures and livestock productivity. <br>
  Adding PFAC increases potential benefit for  families to invest in FM underlying potential interesting complementarities. When  few pastures are degraded, PFAC improves cattle productivity on the long-term. Nonetheless,  as PFAC is an intensification technique, it cannot be performed while investing  in livestock.  </p>
