      <h1>ReefGame: a role-playing game to explore livelihood alternatives in 
        traditional fishing communities in Bolinao (Philippines)</h1>
      <h1><font size="3">D. Cleland, A. Dray, P. Perez, A. Trinidad, R. Geronimo</font></h1>
      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <p>ReefGame is part of the work being done by the <a href="http://www.gefcoral.org/WorkingGroups/ModellingandDecisionSupport/tabid/864/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Modelling 
        and Decision Support group of the Coral Reef Targeted Research Project</a>. 
        The game aims to increase understanding of fishers' behaviour and livelihood 
        choices in the context of declining marine resources and coral reef degradation 
        for both researchers and fishers themselves. The game setting engages 
        fishers in lively discussions and reflections about available options 
        that would secure both their daily needs and the long-term sustainability 
        of the reefs.</p>
      <h2>Description of the game</h2>
      <p><b><img src="../../images/applica/reefGame.jpg" width="315" height="342" align="right"></b>The 
        game is supported by two identical boards representing a virtual coastal 
        area with an offshore island. Information available on the board is: the 
        natural habitat (mangrove, seagrass, and coral) and the players' home. 
        An Agent Based Model (ABM) of the game is run during the playing sessions 
        to compute and deliver fishing catches, players' incomes and habitat transitions.<br>
      </p>
      <p>10 paired players are allocated on each board and take the role of fisherman 
        and head of family. Players' profile includes number of members in his 
        household, income needs and boat type. Each player's objective is to provide 
        enough food for his/her family through fishing and/or extra activity incomes.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The game is divided into 5 steps, each one being played for 1 to 4 rounds. 
        The first step is dedicated to fishing procedures. The second step introduces 
        alternative livelihood procedures while the third step focuses on household 
        procedures. Fourth and fifth steps aim to explore respectively Marine 
        Protected Areas and Tourism activities. Debriefing sessions are held between 
        steps to capture players' decisions and understanding of the game. An 
        important final debriefing stage is then dedicated to collective analysis 
        of the situation and proposals for new scenarios. <br>
      </p>
      <h2>Use of the game</h2>
      <p>The game has been played once during a 1-day workshop involving 20 participants, 
        13 men and 7 women, belonging to fishing communities from the Bolinao 
        province. The experience is to be replicated in other fishing communities 
        as well as in an academic context (learning tool for students). </p>
      <h2>Software</h2>
      <p>You can download the Cormas model source code as a <a href="/logiciel/ReefGame.zip" target="_blank">folder</a> 
        to be able to run the model with cormas or as a <a href="/logiciel/ReefGame-code.pdf" target="_blank">listing</a>.</p>
