      <h2>Agent-based Watershed Analyses for Resource and Economic Sustainability</h2>
      <p>S. Farolfi (coordinator) - S. Perret - L. Erasmus - P. Bommel</p>
      <p>The National Water Act of South Africa promotes integrated and decentralised 
        water resource management as well as the set-up of new institutions. The 
        main objective of the National Water Resource Strategy (NWRS) is to match 
        and balance water demand with water supply, according to sustainability, 
        equity and efficiency objectives.</p>
      <p>The implementation of the Act and its' related NWRS face many social 
        questions and economic uncertainties, owing to a context of water scarcity, 
        profusion of users and uses, backlogs and inequalities in infrastructure 
        and water supply. In this context it is believed that one of the key tasks 
        that is incumbent upon Catchment Management Agencies and Committees (CMAs 
        - CMCs) is to regulate and control water demand.</p>
      <p>The approach set up for this purpose is the allocation of water use authorisations 
        to users for which a licensing process is necessary. This a process raises 
        a number of questions as to how to prioritise licensing between different 
        use and users, when and how should the licenses be revised and what might 
        be the impact of certain licensing strategies.</p>
      <p>AWARE is a multi-agent systems model constructed in Cormas &copy; to 
        investigate the economic efficiency, environmental sustainability and 
        social desirability of some of the potential water management strategies 
        that Catchment Management Committees could use. Although actual processes 
        are unfolding and developing progressively, AWARE aims at investigating 
        situations whereby once established, CMAs and CMCs would handle the licensing 
        processes. It is a prospective simulation-oriented tool.</p>
      <p>The perspectives and behaviour of the Catchment Management Agency (CMA) 
        and the individual users are represented in AWARE. These individual users 
        include communities, irrigation boards, forestry agencies, industries 
        and mines.</p>
      <p>The Steelpoort sub basin in the Olifants river catchments has been selected 
        as study area because of its complete representation of the major sectors 
        of water use and the availability of data. Attributes of the Steelpoort 
        sub basin such as elevation means annual run-off. Land use has been obtained 
        from a geographic information system (GIS). The average annual run-off 
        is used to calculate the total volume of water that is available to the 
        CMA, and includes water available for licensing for human utilisation 
        and water available for the preservation of essential ecosystems (ecological 
        reserve).</p>
      <p>Water quotas are allocated and issued by the CMA every 5 years. When 
        licenses are to be issued, water users (urban and rural communities, irrigation 
        boards, livestock farmers, forestry agencies, industries and mines) send 
        an estimate of water demand to the CMA. If the demand for water for which 
        the CMA will issue licenses is higher than the water demanded by all the 
        users, each user will receive a quota or license for the amount of water 
        it has requested. If the water demanded is more than the volume to be 
        licensed, the CMA prioritises the issuing of licenses according to one 
        of five strategies below:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>No prioritisation. All users receive licenses for a percentage of 
          the amount of water that they have requested. This percentage is the 
          same for all users and depends on the overall available resource. The 
          ecological reserve is not used in licensing.</li>
        <li>Social strategy. Urban and rural communities are issued with licenses 
          first. The rest of the users share remaining unlicensed water proportionately 
          so that all users receive licenses for an equivalent percentage of what 
          they have requested. The ecological reserve is not used in licensing.</li>
        <li>Rural strategy. Smallholders as well as irrigation boards are prioritised 
          after the rural communities have received licences. After these three 
          user categories, remaining unlicensed water is shared between the remaining 
          users. All such users receive licenses for equivalent percentages of 
          what they had demanded. The ecological reserve is not used in licensing.</li>
        <li>Ecological-economic strategy. Mines and industries are prioritised 
          for water licensing. Thereafter the rest of the users share remaining 
          unlicensed water. All such users receive a license for an equivalent 
          percentage of the water they have demanded. The ecological reserve is 
          not used in licensing.</li>
        <li>Economic strategy. Again mines and industries are prioritised for 
          water licensing. Water licenses are allocated to the rest of the users 
          as such that all users receive a license for an equivalent percentage 
          of the water they have demanded. If the water licensed to these users 
          is less than what they have requested, the ecological reserve will also 
          be licensed by the CMA.<br>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Each type of user is charged a sector-dependent price per unit of water 
        for which they receive quotas. These quotas are used to calculate the 
        annual income for the CMA. The CMA's income is therefore independent of 
        the actual amount of water received by the users. In order to calculate 
        the actual annual volume of water received by the users, a periodic fluctuation 
        around the mean annual runoff, representative of the South African climate, 
        was used. If the annual run-off is more than or equal to the amount of 
        water licensed by the CMA, each user receives the same volume of water 
        as per received license. If the annual run-off is less than the volume 
        of water licensed by the CMA, each user receives a proportionate percentage 
        of the water it has been granted a license for. This proportion is equivalent 
        to the percent of water licensed by the CMA that is available in runoff 
        in that particular year. </p>
      <p>Each user makes an annual assessment of the amount of water it receives. 
        If the water quota is less than satisfactory, a complaint of water shortage 
        is sent to the CMA. A users level of satisfaction depends on its sector 
        of water use. After five years, licenses for water use are reallocated 
        (the basic time frame for the model is a year). </p>
      <p>AWARE is useful for investigating the economic, environmental and social 
        consequences of strategies that the CMAs may use in issuing licenses for 
        water allocation. The model can be used to compare different strategies 
        in terms of economic effectiveness, environmental sustainability and social 
        desirability. Since AWARE is individual-based, it is useful in elucidating 
        global outcomes resulting from individual behaviours that otherwise would 
        only have become obvious though trial-error management. </p>
      <p>AWARE can only be applied to situations for which the model was originally 
        constructed. In other words the model cannot be used to investigate the 
        effectiveness of the CMA's management strategies under economic scenarios 
        of growth or stasis or social scenarios such as the effect of HIV/Aids 
        on water demand since these factors have not been incorporated in the 
        model.<br>
