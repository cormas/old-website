The project is based on two premises:              1) the adaptation to climate change is not something that can be              done in an isolated way, and 2) management based on ecosystems is              a solid foundation for a successful adaptation to climate change              in Latin America.<br>              &nbsp;<!--StartFragment--> </p>            <p style="margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm">This              model focuses on a lake in the area of Jujuy: the Ciénaga dam. It              is fed by runoff from the small basin, but also through the water              channels from the Rio Grande and the Rio Perico. In contrast, it              feeds two agricultural areas where irrigation is practiced. The              first challenge is to maintain a satisfactory level of water in              the lake to supply the nearby town drinking water and to supply              irrigation areas, depending on weather conditions and changes in              river flows. The second challenge is to maintain a satisfactory              water quality, both to supply the city, but also to maintain              aquatic life. This quality also attracts tourists who enjoy the              place while contributing to its degradation. Because this place              attracts many people that are installed in houses untreated sewage              goes directly into the lake.</p>            <img title="Legende" alt="" src="../../images/applica/cienagaLegende.png">            <p><!--EndFragment--> </p>            <h3>The start</h3>            <p>At the start of a simulation, the user is invited to choose some              elements of the initial configuration (number of houses in each              area of the basin), and parameters related to the dynamics of the              system: annual growth rate and forcing variables (files of 30              years data: precipitation, flow of the Rio Grande and irrigation              demand)</p>            <img title="DecisionSheet" alt="DecisionSheet image" src="../../images/applica/cienaga2.JPG"><br>            <br>            <h3> Description and characteristics</h3>            <h3> </h3>            <p>The following diagram shows the general structure of the model:</p>            <h1> </h1>            <p><!--EndFragment--> </p>            <img style="width: 889px; height: 929px;" title="Class Diagram" alt="ClassDiag"              src="../../images/applica/cienaga_ClassDiag.png"><br>            The basin is divided into plots of 400 m2 and also in areas and            zones.
