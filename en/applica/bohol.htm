      <h2>Natural Resource Management of the Municipality of Loon in Bohol, Philippines.</h2>

      <p align="left"><img src="../../images/applica/boho01.JPG" width="300" height="225" alt="Coast of Loon, Bohol" align="left">The 
        Bohol model is one of the results of a research exploring the use of MAS 
        modeling that incorporates GIS and remote sensing techniques and artifacts, 
        in developing support tools which could be used to facilitate learning 
        and fostering a participatory approach in policy-making for natural resource 
        management.</p>
      <p align="left">To be able to build the simulation model a two-part fieldwork 
        in the study area was conducted by a research team to familiarize themselves 
        with the people’s perception of their current NRM situation and its problems. 
        The fieldwork allowed the researchers to gather spatial information on 
        the study area, and details about activities of the locals with regards 
        to the use of their natural resources were gathered through workshops, 
        interviews and group discussions. A satellite image (2000 Landsat Image) 
        was also used to get the land use/cover information of the study area. 
        All these information were processed and integrated in the MAS simulation 
        model.</p>
      <p align="left">The model included two main stakeholders, namely the inhabitants 
        and the local government unit (LGU). 3 types of inhabitants were considered 
        for the model: (1) slash-and-burn farmers; (2) subsistence fishermen; 
        and (3) fishpond workers. The slash-and-burn farmers would turn forest 
        areas to farm lands then abandon them after several cultivation cycles. 
        The fishermen would fish only on shallow areas, but they may also perform 
        fishing activities in mangrove areas, wherein no human activity is permitted 
        as they were all declared as sanctuaries by the LGU. The slash-and-burn 
        farmers and fishermen also go to the forest to gather firewood and quarry 
        limestone to augment their insufficient income. The fishpond workers would 
        put poison in their ponds after harvest, which eventually drain to the 
        sea. Another activity of the fishpond workers is to replace the bottom 
        of the pond after four harvests. To do this, they would have to quarry 
        for limestone on mountainsides. The old bottom from the fishpond would 
        then be used to repair the dumped on sides of roads. The LGU on the other 
        hand is tasked reforest the mangrove areas and declare them as sanctuaries.</p>
      <p align="left">Eight scenarios were set-up based on the combinations of 
        the actions to be taken by the fishermen and the LGU. On each scenario, 
        all the fishermen could either be following the law on sanctuaries (i.e. 
        no human activity in the mangrove areas are performed), breaking the law, 
        or each of them could be randomly breaking the law. Also, the fishermen 
        would ask the LGU to give limited access to the sanctuaries. The LGU could 
        perform the following tasks depending on the scenario: (1) don’t perform 
        any mangrove reforestation activity and ignore the requests of the fishermen; 
        (2) perform mangrove reforestation, but ignore the requests of the fishermen; 
        or (3) perform mangrove reforestation and give limited access to the sanctuaries. 
        The results of the scenarios were analyzed using charts, change-detection 
        maps and cross tabulations of land use/cover change.</p>

      <p align="left">The use of spatially-explicit models, such as GIS and RS 
        models, as a learning tool offer the participants of an NRM situation 
        a new way to see their natural resources and environment by means of digital 
        maps. It’s a way for them to see their environment from “outside the box.” 
        Through its use, the MAS models may enhance the learning experience by 
        means of a running simulation. The participants of an NRM situation may 
        see the MAS model simulation as a “movie” about themselves and their possible 
        future with them being the actors of this movie. Adding GIS and RS techniques 
        to analyze the results of the simulation may add to this experience by 
        offering ways to visualize the results of the actors’ actions such as 
        change-detection maps and cross-tabulations.</p>
