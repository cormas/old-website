        a Multi-Agent System/Network Theory coupled approach</h2>

      <h2 align="left">Context </h2>
      <p align="left">Coleman et. al. study on adoption of a new drug by doctors 
        is the premier one to focus on social networks as a prime component in 
        the diffusion process. This very well documented study from the late 1950s 
        tried to demonstrate that the new drug is diffused through a snowball 
        or chain reaction process. Far from discarding the influence of individual 
        characteristics or the external role played by the pharmaceutical industry, 
        the authors argue that innovators, in this context, are socially well 
        connected and that late adopters are relatively isolated. The main limitation 
        of the study recognized by the authors is coming from the limited analytical 
        tools available at that time. The authors had to study separately influences 
        from individual characteristics, media of communication, and social networks. 
        The latter was assessed through pair-analysis without any possibility 
        to handle the network structure as a whole entity. </p>
      <h2 align="left">Modelling Framework </h2>
      <p align="left">Gammanym, an agent-based model, is built with Cormas, according 
        to the information coming from the original study. The medical community 
        is portrayed in a 8x8 spatial grid. The model includes 100 individual 
        doctors located in different types of practices: Private (alone in office), 
        Centre (shared office with two colleagues) and Clinic (working with four 
        colleagues). The doctors may attend local hospitals or medical conferences 
        and exchange information about the new drugs with colleagues. Each doctor 
        is eventually part of a friendship network. The pharmaceutical laboratory 
        can influence the doctors by sending them detail men, flyers, or medical 
        journals. Each doctor makes his decision about adopting the drug according 
        to the number of external influences he has received. Depending on the 
        set of initial conditions, the adoption curves displayed in the original 
        study can be replicated. Furthermore, at each time step, matrices of interactions 
        are exported and analysed from a Network Theory viewpoint. Global characteristics 
        of the different networks are inferred and are used to define critical 
        structures enhancing the chain reaction processes. </p>
      <h2 align="left">Adoption process </h2>
      <p align="left">Doctors' decisions to adopt a new drug involve interdependent 
        local interactions among different entities. Based on a theory of five 
        cognitive stages of adoption (Coleman, Katz and Menzel, 1966; Van den 
        Bulte and Lilien, 1999), we specify their adoption thresholds or readiness 
        as a step four process. Readiness is decremented when they receive an 
        alert from different sources. At each time step, discussions with friends 
        and colleagues, as well as information from the lab, generates an alert. 
        Discussions with other doctors, either friends or colleagues at practices, 
        conferences, or hospitals generate an alert when the mean adoption rate 
        is 0.50 or above. Doctors' readiness is gradually reduced with alerts 
        from all the aforementioned sources. When the readiness reaches zero, 
        doctors adopt the new drug. </p>
      <h2 align="left">Simulation</h2>
      <p align="left">Depending on three sets of initial conditions, cumulative 
        diffusion curves, representing the total number of adopted doctors at 
        each time step are markedly different. As several random functions are 
        included in the algorithm, each scenario is repeated for 100 times in 
        order to estimate output's variability. The three scenarios are specified 
        to evaluate the degree of influences by different factors in the diffusion 
        process: i. Baseline Scenario with one innovator (seed), one detailman 
        and one journal; ii. Heavy Media Scenario with different degrees of external 
        influence, by varying the number of detailman (5) and number of journals 
        (4); and iii. Integration Scenario without any external influence. </p>
      <p align="left">Network variables, like clustering coefficient, degree distribution 
        and average shortest path length are calculated to evaluate how and to 
        what extent, network structure influences the diffusion process. All of 
        above indicate that social networks depicted in Gammanym are random graphs. 
        The analysis of network topology reveals that initially the system consisted 
        of a number of disconnected components and quickly saturates after 7-10 
        time steps to form a giant clusters. </p>
      <p align="left">Analysis on evolution of uptake suggests that under heavy 
        media scenario the average size of clusters with agents who have adopted 
        rise much faster than those of the other two scenario. Gammanym therefore 
        shows that though media do not influence the network structure, the speed 
        of diffusion is largely determined by the extent of media influence. </p>
