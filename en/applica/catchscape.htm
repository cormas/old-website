      <p align="left"><img src="../../images/applica/scape1.jpg" width="291" height="190" align="right">In 
        April 1998, an extraordinary event took place in Northern Thailand. Five 
        thousands lowland Thai farmers from the district of Chom Thong occupied 
        and blocked one of the district's main roads. They were demanding the 
        forced relocation of almost 20,000 hill-tribe villagers whom they accused 
        to cause widespread environmental damage: deforestation, forest fires 
        and streamflow drying. This event was the first sign of a global emerging 
        conflict between lowland and upland farmers of Northern Thailand about 
        natural resources management [Scoccimarro et al., 1999]. On one hand, 
        upland settlers are accused of reducing streamflow, through deforestation, 
        and, on the other hand, lowland farmers are increasing their demand over 
        water. Moreover, the conflict is emphasized by ethnical differences between 
        upland and lowland people. Regarding the complexity of the existing interactions, 
        solutions may only arise from local negotiation. But stakeholders need 
        descriptive, integrative and anticipating tools in order to share a common 
        view and to reach a sound consensus. </p>
      <h2 align="left"><img src="../../images/applica/scape2.jpg" width="373" height="280" align="left">Towards 
        a fully integrative model</h2>
      <p align="left"> In order to focus on social interactions and resources 
        management, we have first defined the farmers as cognitive agents (Farmer) 
        and then, the other elements that compose the farmer's environment: the 
        crops (Crop), the river (River), the irrigation canal (Canal) and the 
        village (Village) have been created as reactive entities. The Farmer has 
        to manage four main resources and their interactions: water, labor, cash 
        and land. The catchment has been schematically represented in order to 
        sketch the different levels of organization of the relevant spatial units. 
        First, the Land Units combine soil texture, soil depth and land slope. 
        The second spatial representation concerns Land Use: Paddy, Upland and 
        Forest. the Paddy zone is an irrigated area composed of a multitude of 
        bounded terraces on which farmers mainly crop rice during the wet season. 
        The Upland zone is constituted with rainfed plots spread all over the 
        hillsides and cropped either with rice, soybean or vegetables. Forest, 
        mainly used for gathering and religious ceremony, is described as a sempervirens 
        sole type cover. </p>
      <h2 align="left">Model description </h2>
      <p align="left"><img src="../../images/applica/scape3.jpg" width="140" height="168" align="left">The 
        unit cell (Plot) that composes the modelling grid (44*45), corresponds 
        to a 2-rai farm plot (1 rai = 0.16 ha), which is the average size encountered 
        in the Mae Uam catchment. Farmers are characterized by their family size 
        and labor force. they can initially own upland and/or paddy plots according 
        to their status. A paddy Plot belongs to a Canal. There are six Canals 
        in the system, organized by pair and grouped into two irrigated schemes. 
        A cognitive agent, called Manager, manages the weir controlling a Canal. 
        The irrigated schemes belong to one zone each (Village) corresponding 
        to the upstream and downstream groups of actual villages. The biophysical 
        dynamics are simulated through a distributed water balance model and a 
        hydraulic model [Perez et al., 2001]. First, Farmers choose the most profitable 
        crop <img src="../../images/applica/scape4.jpg" width="297" height="308" align="right">according 
        to their constraints in cash, labor force and water availability. Except 
        for rice during the wet season, the Crop choice is based on a simplified 
        Linear Programming model taking into account seasonal farming costs, water 
        and labor requirements.This initial Crop choice may be modified if the 
        growth duration doesn't reasonably fit within seasonal boundaries. The 
        planting date is delayed as long as Farmer's cash and labor force can't 
        match the land preparation and planting requirements. Rice cultivation 
        is mostly motivated by food security strategies. Thus, within the model, 
        Farmers are forced to plant rice at the beginning of the rainy season 
        as long as their yield expectation doesn't reach their family needs, cash 
        and labor resources permitting. At the beginning of the dry season, Farmers 
        have to decide whether they allocate part of their labor force to off-farm 
        activities or not. Finally, Farmers have to make decisions about land 
        dynamics. Three opportunities are offered to the cognitive agents. First, 
        Farmers can buy available Plots. Then, they can decide to install irrigation 
        on rainfed Plots (located in the uplands), in order to farm them during 
        the dry season. At last, Farmers can convert forest Plots into upland 
        Plots. Paired Canals enter into an irrigation rotation as soon as the 
        downstream canal faces water shortage. The upstream Manager is forced 
        to accept the rotation but may stop it if the River's streamflow comes 
        back to normal. Negotiations may involve Managers from different groups 
        of paired Canals and, eventually, from different Villages. In this case, 
        downstream Managers still send requests to the upstream ones but the later 
        are not forced to respond positively. </p>
      <h2 align="left">Preliminary results </h2>
      <p align="left">Each scenario has been run over a 10-years period, corresponding 
        to the existing climate data set . As several random functions are included 
        in the algorithm, the scenarios have been repeated 20 times in order to 
        estimate the outputs variability. The user can visualize the spatial and 
        social dynamics during simulations according to different viewpoints (Cropping 
        pattern, soil water balance, irrigation canal depletion, individual cash, 
        conditions of negotiation…). At the end of the simulation, a set of indicators 
        can be edited through evolution charts or export files [Bousquet et al., 
        1999]. In the basic scenario, social inequity has dramatically increased 
        in the catchment at the end of the 10-year period. Approximately 10% of 
        the Farmers enjoy a positive cash position (Rich) and gradually increase 
        their wealth. Some of them are rich enough to invest into upland irrigation 
        (15 cases). Meanwhile, 40% of the Farmers (Poor) enter a permanent and 
        worsening deficit position. The remaining 50% hardly maintain their economic 
        buoyancy. Even if Farmers initially entitled with only 2 upland Plots 
        partly feed the Poor category, the irrigated Plot location along the Canal 
        largely contributes to its owner economic achievements. For example, during 
        the dry season, the upstream Canal (C1) can secure enough water to irrigated 
        approximately 65% of its Plots. But the downstream Canal (C6) can hardly 
        support 20% of the connected Plots. In this case, as Farmers were endowed 
        with the ability to learn from previous failures, gradually, the number 
        of attempts to crop during the dry season decreases. </p>
