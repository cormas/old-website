      <p>This model demonstrates the principles of Cormas communicating agents. 
        Communicating agents have a mailbox and use a communicating channel to 
        deliver messages in the mailboxes of the other agents belonging to their 
        social network.</p>
      In this exercice, 10 &quot;farmer&quot; agents are randomly located on a 
      10 x 10 spatial grid, each cell standing for a plot of land. Each farmer 
      receives initially 10 plots, randomly chosen. He estimates the productivity 
      of a plot according to its distance. The calculation on his potential income 
      is based on this single criteria. Four ways of organizing the rentals of 
      the plots have been implemented. 
      <p><img src="/images/applica/plotsrental1c.gif" width="195" height="169" align="left">The 
        first scenario is a bidding process that relies on a centralized contract 
        net protocol. An auctioneer offers all plots to all farmers. These farmers 
        having sent back proposals, the auctioneer selects the best one for each 
        plot and finalizes the rental contract with the sender of the best proposal. 
        The result of this first version of the model is a &quot;perfect&quot; 
        land regrouping process, in the sense that any plot is systematically 
        rent to the closest farmer. </p>
      <p>The three other scenarios are simulating a decentralized functionning: 
        the exchanges of rental proposals do not go through the auctioneer anymore. 
        It's rather a kind of mutual agreement that the farmers are looking for. 
        In a first case, all the farmers know each others. Each one proposes his 
        plots to the others. Then each one selects the best proposal for each 
        of his plots, and finalizes the rental contracts. The result is the same 
        than for the first scenario: as the information is symetric, the optimal 
        solution is reached.</p>
      <p><img src="../../images/applica/plotsrental2.gif" width="196" height="206" align="left"><img src="/images/applica/plotsrental2c.gif" width="195" height="169" align="right">The 
        second distributed version (third scenario) introduces two groups of five 
        farmers, randomly made. These 2 groups are shown on the window that enable 
        the observation of the communication (right picture): group 1 with agents 
        1;5;6;9;8 and group 2 with agents 7;3;4;10;2. Now that each agent only 
        knows half of the whole population, a kind a social asymetric of information 
        is introduced. This feature leads to a non-optimal solution, as can be 
        seen on the left picture: famer 2 (deep blue) and farmer 1 (black) have 
        not communicated, therefore their domain are overlapping. </p>
      <p>A last scenario emphasizes this asymetric of information, by assuming 
        an asynchronous way of communication between the members of each group: 
        as soon as a farmer receives an interesting proposal, he immediatly finalizes 
        the contract without waiting for any other proposal. In this version with 
        social and temporal asymetric of information, the land regrouping process 
        is even less optimized. </p>
