      <p>This model introduces the functionning principles of Cormas aggregative 
        spatial entities. In the inheritage tree of the Cormas generic spatial 
        entities, the compound spatial entity &quot;SpatialEntity_Set&quot; is 
        specialized in :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>&quot;SpatialEntity_Aggregate&quot;, whose components should be contiguous</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>&quot;SpatialEntity_Set_notConnex&quot;, whose components may not 
          be contiguous.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The operations of aggregation-disintegration are based on the two attributes 
        &quot;components&quot; (a collection of lower level spatial entities) 
        and &quot;theCSE&quot; (a register of belonging to higer level spatial 
        entities). </p>
      <p>The TSE model is a didactic model that allows to test two different ways 
        to create spatial aggregates with Cormas. </p>
      <p>In the first one, the components are defined as sets of contiguous cells 
        sharing a same condition. The first step is to load a spatial grid made 
        of 50*50 cells (instances of the &quot;TSE_Cell&quot; class) from a file. 
        Each cell has either #tree (aggregation condition) or #empty as value 
        of its &quot;context&quot; attribute. The effective instanciations from 
        the compound spatial entity &quot;TSE_Aggregate&quot; are submitted to 
        an additional constraint about a minimum number (set to 25) of contiguous 
        components verifying the aggregation condition. To let co-exist in the 
        same model several spatial entities defined at different levels gives 
        a great flexibility to write the dynamics of the model. Some of the processes 
        are more easily described at the cellular level, as for some others, the 
        aggregated level is more suitable. In this didactic and simplistic example, 
        each cell has a fixed (very low) probability to switch its &quot;context&quot; 
        attribute value. At the level of the aggregates, a spreading process from 
        the edges is written like this: a given number (corresponding to the hundredth 
        of the total number of components of the forestry entity) of cells at 
        the outside edge are going to be aggregated to the forest. In order to 
        keep a high compacity to the forestry entities, a priority is given to 
        the cells that are surrounded by the highest number of already aggregated 
        cells. </p>
      <p>In the second one, 10 &quot;seed&quot; cells are randomly chosen in the 
        50*50 spatial grid. 10 aggregates are intialized with one of these seeds 
        as a single component. The iterative building process of the aggregates 
        relies on the integration, among the cells belonging to the outside edge 
        of each aggregate, of all the one that do not yet belong to another aggregate.
