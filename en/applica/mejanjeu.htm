      <h2>A role-game based on a simplified version of the <a href="mejan.htm">Mejan 
        model</a></h2>
      <p>Michel Etienne (Inra), Christophe Le Page (Cirad)</p>
 
      <p>The Mejan role-game aims at stimulating farmers, foresters and nature 
        rangers to react to natural vegetation dynamics supposed to occur in a 
        near future. It is based on a representation of a natural area near enough 
        of reality to permit to the players to feel at home but far enough of 
        that reality to stay in a neutral context and to avoid local conflicts. 
        The role-game is built upon the coupling between a simplified MAS and 
        a GIS that permits to rapidly edit thematic maps at different scales. 
      </p>
      <p>In the simplified agent-based model used as a support for the role-game, 
        only space and time scales are modified, the pine dynamics rules and the 
        sensitivity of plant and animal species to changes in their habitat being 
        similar to the <a href="mejan.htm">Mejan agent-based model</a>. The participants 
        playing the role of the farmers decide where and how much to graze according 
        to their production system and the level of pine encroachment of the paddocks. 
        The participants playing the role of the nature rangers decide where are 
        the major conservation spots and define their best strategy to control 
        pine encroachment. The participants playing the role of the foresters 
        define the primary objectives of the wooded areas and propose a management 
        and exploitation plan of these woodlands. At the end of each round, a 
        short negotiation is hold in order to decide where to operate, with which 
        technique and who does the work. A set of cartographic representations 
        of the impact of the negotiated operations on the dynamics of the natural 
        resources is provided to support the decisions made during the following 
        round. </p>
      <p>The minimal configuration of the role-game is 4 farmer-players facing 
        2 forester-players and 2 nature ranger-players. It has only been used 
        with real local managers and farmers playing their real role, that is 
        the reason why each production system must be represented. Similarly, 
        fauna and flora viewpoints must be dissociated because they do not use 
        similar evaluation scales. The role-game permits an easy access to the 
        formalisation of the interaction between agents and warranties a rapid 
        understanding of the pine encroachment process. Overall, it gives a total 
        liberty to the players to invent operation strategies and negotiation 
        tactics in order to hit their targets and to find a compromise between 
        the agent who suffer from pine encroachment and agents who are the source 
        of the process.</p>
      <p> The output of the role-game is crucial because it is the only way to 
        build up new but realistic behaviours and practice adaptations of farmers 
        and nature rangers in front of a biological process they have nor still 
        been confronted with. </p>
