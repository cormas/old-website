      <h1>SimDrug <br>
        Exploring the complexity of the heroin drug use in Melbourne (Australia)</h1>
      <h1><font size="3">A. Dray and P. Perez</font></h1>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>SimDrug is a multi-agent system model, built with Cormas, as part of 
        the <a href="http://www.turningpoint.org.au/research/dm_proj/res_dm_proj.htm" target="_blank">Drug 
        Policy Modeling Project</a>, led by Turning Point, a specialist alcohol 
        and drug organization based in Melbourne. The project aims at addressing 
        a demand for new integrative approaches to support policy makers and practitioners 
        who implement illicit drug policy in Australia.</p>
      <p>SimDrug focuses on the representation of dynamic relationships between 
        law enforcement, treatment, harm reduction and prevention. Its design 
        is based upon a real case-study: the heroin 'drought' that struck the 
        illicit drug market in Melbourne in 2000. The supply of heroin in Melbourne 
        suffered a dramatic decline between late 2000 and early 2001, after a 
        strong increase in heroin use and related harms in the late 1990s. This 
        change in heroin supply led to a substantial decrease in overdoses. Field 
        experts argue that the drought was actually shadowed by a dramatic increase 
        in psycho stimulants, resulting in a fairly constant number of injecting 
        drug. On the other hand, the heroin drought is held up by the Australian 
        Government as an example of law enforcement (seizure, syndicates dismantlement) 
        having a significant impact on the supply of drugs. </p>
      <h2>Model description</h2>
      <p><b><img src="../../images/applica/simDrugSpatialGrid.jpeg" width="384" height="384" align="right">Time 
        scale<br>
        </b>One time step is equivalent to a 24h-day in reality as injecting behaviors 
        need accurate time scale. Each simulation is run over a 5-year period 
        (1998 - 2002 dataset) to allow the model to be able to consistently reproduce 
        pre-drought, crisis, and post-drought dynamics of the system.</p>
      <p><b>Spatial environment</b><br>
        SimDrug works on an archetypal representation of Melbourne based on a 
        regular 50*50 square mesh, each cell representing a street block. Five 
        suburbs (defined as an aggregation of neighboring cells) are created with 
        different sizes and shapes, regardless of realistic features. Two special 
        cells represent the Police Station and the Treatment Center. </p>
      <p><b>Social entities</b><br>
        SimDrug includes different types of social agents: 3000 users, 150 dealers, 
        10 wholesalers, 10 constables, and 10 outreach workers. Figures are based 
        on a 1:10 scale of the reality.</p>
      <p><b>Model dynamics</b><br>
        Each time step encompasses the following stages: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The population of agents, based on the changes triggered during the 
          previous time step is updated. All detainees are retrieved from the 
          system and new users, dealers and wholesalers are created accordingly.</li>
        <li>Wholesalers and dealers interact towards drug supply. Wholesalers 
          are given the opportunity to refill their supply once a month while 
          dealers can visit their wholesaler as soon as their drug stock is sold 
          out. </li>
        <li>Outreach workers interact with users in order to decrease their readiness 
          for treatment and convince them to enter into treatment.</li>
        <li>Users interact with their environment and other agents. They start 
          by assessing their need looking at their available cash and drug and 
          decide whether they need to commit a crime. They, then, find their usual 
          dealer (or alternatively a new dealer) and buy some drug. They use it 
          at once and might declare an overdose. </li>
        <li>The Treatment Center manages new users entering treatments and on-going 
          treated users reaching the end of their treatment duration. </li>
        <li>Street blocks risk and conductivity are updated and the new suburbs' 
          protest values are calculated accordingly. </li>
        <li>The police station adapts its strategy by reallocating constables 
          on the grid and eventually performing successful crackdowns. </li>
      </ol>
