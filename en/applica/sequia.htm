Most livestock farms              in the region are settled on basaltic shallow soils. These soils              have very limited capacity to store water in their profile and are              more sensitive to drought. The severity and frequency of the              droughts has jeopardized the sustainability of ranches. In the              late 1990s, livestock breeders experienced severe droughts and              millions of animals died or had to be slaughtered prematurely.              This led to a weakened beef production sector causing numerous              bankruptcies. Additionally, the drought events may occur more              frequently in the future as a result of climate change.</p>            <p>To evaluate the efficiency of different management strategies, we              built an ABM to simulate the evolution of farmers using different              drought strategies. The purpose of the ABM was to build              prospective scenarios under the assumption that future conditions              (climate, prices) will be similar to previous ones during the              2000-2009 decade. </p>            <h3>Model purpose</h3>            <p>The simulation model is designed to explore the impact of              different strategies on the trajectory of livestock farms,              especially taking into account the impact of droughts. The first              model is a standard ABM for which no interactive simulation was              planned. In that version, agents are strong simplifications of              farmers&#8217; behaviors. Two kinds of producers were considered              depending on their corresponding drought strategies: </p>            <ol>              <li>a &#8220;<strong><em>CC</em></strong>&#8221; Producer who focuses on                cattle health or on the Corporal Condition score and </li>              <li>a &#8220;<strong><em>Pasto</em></strong>&#8221; Producer who makes                drought-related decisions by assessing grass availability and                climate.</li>            </ol>            <p><img src="sequia/systemic.GIF" alt="systemic diagram" height="475"                width="634"></p>            <p>Whatever his strategy, a producer owns a 500 ha farm composed of              one single pasture (of a non-defined spatial dimension). The grass              grows according to the logistic equation which parameters change              according to seasonal and climatic conditions. Two herds are              grassing on the farm: sheep that are not affected by drought (they              are able to survive even in extreme conditions) and for which the              dynamics is very simple, and cattle, which are impacted by grass              height and which lifecycle is more finely modeled. The model              consists of three submodels:<br>              - The "Grazing "sub-model represents the grass growth depending on              the season and weather.<br>              - The "wild" sub-model adds the herd that feeds on grass and              grows.<br>              - The "management" sub-model adds a rancher who manages his herd.            </p>            <p><a href="sequia/couplage.GIF"><img src="sequia/couplage.GIF" alt="couplage"                  height="425"                  width="704"></a></p>            <h3>Model description</h3>            <h5>Model structure</h5>            <p>The following class diagram presents the main classes of the              model: </p>            <p><img src="sequia/classDiag.EN.jpg" alt="" height="473" width="1077"></p>            <p>Whatever his strategy ("CC" or "Pasto"), a producer owns a 500 ha              farm composed of one single pasture (of a non-defined spatial              dimension). The grass grows according to the logistic equation              which parameters change according to seasonal and climatic              conditions. Two herds are grassing on the farm: sheep that are not              affected by drought (they are able to survive even in extreme              conditions) and for which the dynamics is very simple, and cattle,              which are impacted by grass height and which lifecycle is more              finely modeled: the cattle herd is made of cohorts of cows (a              group of individuals born at the same time period). When getting              older, all the animals of a cohort will growth and change their              state at the same time (calves, young adults then reproductive              adults). As they share the same characteristics, we assume that              they are similarly affected by external events such as droughts.              In other words, the cohort agent is a cow plus a specific              attribute: number of animals of this cohort. The sheep herd class              is modeled as a simple entity without cohort, but it has got an              attribute (num, inherited by <em>Herd</em> class) and even if its              dynamics is very simple, it grazes. Thus it has an effect on the              grass height: each sheep eats 2% of its weight per day. So the              sheep herd is a competitor to the cattle for grazing. <em><br>              </em>The model is deterministic but some input parameters (climate              data, meat prices, availability and prices of extra farmland              leasing of Environment class) have been added as &#8220;forcing              variables&#8221;. These time series gathered during the 2000-2009 decade              influence the simulations: they play the role of one climatic and              market scenario for which various farmers&#8217; management strategies              will be examined. </p>            <h5>Time step</h5>            <p>As the farmers have distinct seasonal activities, the time-step              for the simulations corresponds to one season. But a one-day              sub-step is needed to more accurately represent the interactions              between grass growth and herds grazing (cattle and sheep). The              task scheduling order (i.e. order in which the behaviors of agents              and resources are called upon at every time step) is shown on              following sequence diagram: </p>            <p><img src="sequia/sequence1.png" alt="sequencia" height="266" width="763"></p>            <p>By testing alternative strategies with the executable editor, the              participants identified some model biases: they realized that in              drought conditions, the agents always reacted too late. For              instance, in case of poor health of the herd or in case of lack of              grass, the decision to feed the herd with supplement did not              apparently prevent it from collapsing. The participants understood              that during crises, the agents had to act more frequently than              only once per season as stated by the first model version. The              consequence being that we intend to correct the model by repeating              the seasonal activities of the agents every week rather than only              once a season:</p>            <p><img src="sequia/sequence2.png" alt="sequence diag version 2" height="318"                width="876"></p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <h4>The states of a cohort</h4>            <p>The following state-transition shows the life cycle of a cohort              of wild cattle with sub-states.</p>            <p><img src="sequia/StateTransition-naturalCycle.jpg" alt="" height="371"                width="725"></p>            <p>From this wild cattle model, 2 state-transition diagrams are              derived, showing the management events of the producers.

The following diagram presents the spring              activities of a &#8220;Pasto&#8221; Producer (green) and a &#8220;CC&#8221; Producer              (orange).</p>            <p>These activities consist mainly in managing the farm and the              herds. Even if, for a given season, the strategies are roughly              similar, differences exist on the decision points for each one:              while the &#8220;CC&#8221; producer surveys the physical condition of his              cattle to guide his managing choices, the &#8220;Pasto&#8221; producer chooses              his activities according to the grass height and by trying to stay              under a low stock threshold. The following animated figure              describes the behavior of both producers (&#8220;Pasto&#8221; Producer: green              and a &#8220;CC&#8221; Producer: orange) during the spring season: even if              they behave in the same way, the guards (squared brackets) of the              main decision points concern the priority of each agent.<a name="activityDiag1"></a></p>            <p><img src="sequia/animatedActivity.gif" alt="" height="440" width="960"></p>            <h3>Some results</h3>            <p>The following simulation curves show the evolution of the pasture              without grazing cattle, according to seasons and climate:</p>            <p><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US" lang="EN-US"> <o:p></o:p>              </span><img src="sequia/result-1.png" alt="result pasture alone" height="581"                width="873"></p>            <p>Result Pasture and wild cattle:</p>            <p><img src="sequia/result-2.png" alt="result pasture and wild cattle"                height="688"                width="850"></p>            <p><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US" lang="EN-US"> <o:p>Some                  result with producer management:<br>                  <img src="sequia/result-3.png" alt="result full" height="598"                    width="763"><br>                  A more detailed description of the model will be available                  soon.</o:p> </span></p>            <h3>The interactive model</h3>            <p>To facilitate the collective design of the model, it was              necessary to immediately assess the consequences of changes. For              that purpose, we created a new tool that enables the drawing of              simple activity diagrams and to execute them without any need for              translation into code. Indeed, this editor allows the creation of              new activity diagrams (or re-opening formers) that are interpreted              &#8220;on the fly&#8221; by Cormas. Then it is possible to modify the              simulator while it is running, without stopping or restarting the              simulation.</p>            <p>For simplicity sake and user friendliness, the elements available              on the diagram editor are restricted to initial and final nodes,              decision points, simple activity nodes (without parameters nor              ability to handle an activity output) and transitions (Fig. 6).              The decision point has also limitations in the sense that only two              transitions come out of it, indicating the fulfillment (true) or              the negative answer (false) of a test. The followinf figure              presents the executable Activity diagram editor displaying the              spring strategy for a collectively designed Producer. Note that              this diagram is equivalent to the one presented in the <a href="#activityDiag1">previous                figure</a>. </p>            <p><img src="sequia/editor.png" alt="editor" height="552" width="732"></p>            <p>By selecting an activity node or a decision point on the tool              bar, the user can add a new element on the diagram. Thereafter, he              can choose the operation to be performed by this element. Each              element proposes a drop-down menu to display an activity setter              from which the user may choose the method that will be associated              with the selected node </p>            <p><img src="sequia/actSetter.png" alt="setter" height="422" width="631"></p>            <p>The activity setter displays a list of methods belonging to the              target class (i.e. Producer). This list is set up automatically by              Cormas that inspects all the simple methods (without argument)              defined within the class and its super-classes. By clicking on a              name, the purpose of the associated method is displayed. It is              also possible inspect the method&#8217;s code by right clicking on it.<strong></strong>              The design is incremental: saving a new diagram generates a new              method of the agent that is immediately available and can be              called in turn (i.e. future activity setter will display this new              method name). A right-click on an activity or a decision point              opens either a code editor targeting the selected operation, or              another diagram editor displaying the previously saved activities.</p>            <p>Therefore, the user can draw a transition from the given node to              another. When starting from a decision point, he will create two              transitions: one for which the answer of the test is <em>true</em>              (green) and one for <em>false</em> (red). When saving the new              diagram, Cormas checks if the graph is coherent, then it generates              two operations in the target class: one to store the diagram and              one to execute it. Thus, from basic operations already defined by              the modeler, anyone may generate new upper level behavior without              any programming skills.</p>            <p>To edit the diagrams or choose which activities will be used              during the simulation, the user selects the names of the methods              that will be implemented at each station:            </p>            <p><img src="sequia/estaciones.JPG" alt="" height="400" width="501"></p>            <hr>            <ul type="disc">              <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:       auto;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo5;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"                  lang="EN-US">Download                  the model (</span><a href="sequia/SequiaBasalto.zip"><span style="mso-ansi-language:       EN-US" lang="EN-US">zipfile</span></a><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"                  lang="EN-US">,                  91Ko.
