      <h1>Downloading Cormas</h1>
      <h2>Updating Cormas</h2>
      <p>If you already have installed Cormas2004 and VisualWorks, you just need 
        to <a href="upgradeCormas.htm">upgrade it</a>.</p>
      <h2>Downloading Cormas</h2>
      <h3>Warning</h3>
      <p>The procedure to install Cormas takes place in 2 phases: firstly, it 
        is necessary to install VisualWorks (the programming language freely available 
        on Cincom web site) then Cormas. Unfortunately , we can not provide a 
        full-In-One including VW and Cormas for <em>legal</em> reasons.</p>
      <p>VisualWorks (free version) is available on <a href="http://www.cincom.com/scripts/smalltalk.dll//downloads/index.ssp?content=visualworks" target="_blank"> 
        Cincom web site</a>. VisualWorks is about <em>60 Mo</em> (virtual machine 
        and base file) and Cormas is about <em>8 Mo</em>.</p>
      <h3>First step: Cormas users' charter </h3>
      <p>Cormas is a free program and can be downloaded by anyone. However, we 
        invite users to read and respect the following charter:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cormas is protected by authors' rights.</li>
        <li>Cormas was developed within a framework of scientific research on 
          the environment and development. It was born from the combination of 
          several approaches to simulation-model construction of multiple-use 
          ecosystems. This originating principle of placing it in the public domain 
          and sharing of experiences characterizes the spirit with which Cormas 
          should be used. It is a tool for exchanges and dialogs regarding the 
          problem of natural-resources management. Users are welcome to use this 
          software in a larger framework but should respect the same usage spirit.</li>
        <li>You can download Cormas after filling in a form which will be sent 
          to the authors (we would like to know the context within which you intend 
          using the software, no information you submit will be distributed or 
          used for commercial purposes).</li>
        <li>You are free to distribute Cormas on the condition of also including 
          the recommendations of this charter, specially on authors' rights and 
          the necessity of identifying yourself as a user.</li>
        <li>If you want to modify Cormas, feel free to do so but do not distribute 
          the modified version. Rather, send your remarks and modification to 
          the user group (via the forum).</li>
        <li>Cormas comes with no guarantees whatsoever. All risks are assumed 
          by the user. </li>
      </ul>
