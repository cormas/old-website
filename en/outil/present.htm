      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>There exist more and more programming environments dedicated to the creation 
        of multi-agent systems. Some of them are oriented towards communication 
        between distributed systems, as some others are more oriented towards 
        the building of simulation models (see <a href="../reseaux/liens.htm">links 
        page</a>).</p>
      <p>The CORMAS programming environment belongs to this second category, with 
        a specificity in the domain of natural-resources management. It provides 
        a framework for developing simulation models of coordination modes between 
        individuals and groups who jointly exploit the resources. This framework 
        is structured in the following three modules (see figure).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first module allows the definition of the entities of the system 
          to be modeled, which are called informatics agents, and their interactions. 
          These interactions are expressed by direct communication procedures 
          (sending of messages) and/or by the fact of sharing the same spatial 
          support.</li>
        <li>The second module deals with the control of the overall dynamics (ordering 
          of different events during a time-step of the model).</li>
        <li>The third module allows the definition of an observation of the simulation 
          depending on viewpoints. This feature allows the integration, within 
          the modelling process, of representation modes.</li>
      </ul>

      <p align="center" class="texte">Cormas' interface</p>
      <p>Cormas facilitates the work of constructing a model by offering predefined 
        elements within these three modules. Among these items are the Cormas 
        entities, which are SmallTalk generic classes from which, by specialization 
        and refining, the user can create entities specific to the needs of his 
        application.</p>
      <p>Cormas is a simulation platform based on the VisualWorks programming 
        environment which allows the development of applications in SmallTalk.</p>
      <p>Cormas can be <a href="outchar.htm">downloaded</a>. <a href="outguid.htm">User's 
        guides</a> are also available. The main <a href="uml-kernel.htm">UML class 
        diagrams</a> of the Cormas kernel are available.</p>
