      <p>There exist a few programming environments dedicated to the creation 
        of multi-agent systems. Some of them are oriented towards communication 
        between distributed systems, and some others are meant for developing 
        simulation models</p>
      <h2>Agents for scientific simulation</h2>
      <p>One can distinguish two great fields for scientific simulation. The first 
        is related to the study of co-operation, competition and auto-regulation 
        mechanisms; It attempts to understand the emergence and collective intelligence 
        concepts. The other field deals with modeling and simulation of complex 
        systems in agronomy, ecology, economy and sociology. The other field concerns 
        the modeling and the simulation of complex systems in various areas such 
        as agronomy, ecology, the economy and sociology.</p>
      <p>Some examples of multi-agent platforms :</p>
      <h3>Ascape </h3>
      <p>Ascape is a software framework for developing and analyzing agent-based 
        models. In Ascape, agent objects exist within <i>scapes</i>; collections 
        of agents such as arrays and lattices. These scapes are themselves agents, 
        so that typical Ascape models are made up of "collections of collections" 
        of agents. Scapes provide a context for agent interaction and sets of 
        rules that govern agent behavior. Ascape manages graphical views and collection 
        of statistics for scapes and provides mechanisms for controlling and altering 
        parameters for scape models. Ascape pursuits <a href="../applica/sugarScape.htm">Sugerscape</a> 
        for the field of the economic surveys. </p>

      <h3>MODULECO</h3>
      <p>MODULECO is a prototype of multi-agent platform, founded on an original 
        data-processing model, designed to simulate the markets, the social phenomena 
        and the dynamics of the populations.</p>
      <p><a href="http://digemer.enst-bretagne.fr/%7Ephan/moduleco/">http://digemer.enst-bretagne.fr/~phan/moduleco/</a></p>
      <h3>MadKit </h3>
      <p>MadKit is a Java programming environment dedicated to the creation of 
        multi-agent systems. It is oriented towards communication between distributed 
        systems. It is built upon an organizational model based on Agents, Groups 
        and R&ocirc;les : an organization is viewed as a framework for activity 
        and interaction through the definition of groups, roles and their relationships. 
        But, by avoiding an agent-oriented viewpoint, an organization is regarded 
        as a structural relationship between a collection of agents. Thus, an 
        organization can be described solely on the basis of its structure, i.e. 
        by the way groups and roles are arranged to form a whole, without being 
        concerned with the way agents actually behave, and multi-agent systems 
        will be analyzed from the ``outside'', as a set of interaction modes. 
        The specific architecture of agents is purposely not addressed. </p>
      <p>MadKit provides general agent facilities (lifecycle management, message 
        passing, distribution, ...), and allows high heterogeneity in agent architectures 
        and communication languages, and various customizations</p>

      <h3>Mobydic</h3>
      <p>Mobidyc is a tool for building and using agent-based models relating 
        to population dynamics. It can be used by biologists without any computing 
        skills (Vincent Ginot).</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.thonon.inra.fr/mobidyc" target="_blank">http://www.thonon.inra.fr/mobidyc</a></p>
      <h3>StarLogo</h3>
      <p>StarLogo is a specialized version of the Logo programming language. With 
        traditional versions of Logo, you can create drawings and animations by 
        giving commands to graphic "turtles" on the computer screen. StarLogo 
        extends this idea by allowing you to control thousands of graphic turtles 
        in parallel. In addition, StarLogo makes the turtles' world computationally 
        active: you can write programs for thousands of "patches" that make up 
        the turtles' environment. Turtles and patches can interact with one another 
        -- for example, you can program the turtles to "sniff" around the world, 
        and change their behaviors based on what they sense in the patches below. 
        StarLogo is particularly well-suited for Artificial Life projects.</p>
      <p>StarLogo is a programmable modeling environment for exploring the workings 
        of decentralized systems -- systems that are organized without an organizer, 
        coordinated without a coordinator. With StarLogo, you can model many real-life 
        phenomena, such as bird flocks, traffic jams, ant colonies, and market 
        economies.</p>

      <h3>Swarm</h3>
      <p>Swarm is a software package for multi-agent simulation of complex systems, 
        originally developed at the Santa Fe Institute. Swarm is intended to be 
        a useful tool for researchers in a variety of disciplines. The basic architecture 
        of Swarm is the simulation of collections of concurrently interacting 
        agents: &quot;with this architecture, we can implement a large variety 
        of agent based models&quot;. </p>

      <h2>Mobile agents and assistants </h2>
      <p>Because of the economic repercussions, this category of agents is mainly 
        attached to the commercial field. They allow either an assistance to the 
        user (the synchronization and the management of diaries, e-mail filtering, 
        memory of the user...), or the adaptive search for information (indexing 
        of documents, request in data base, co-operative search), or the commercial 
        activity (E-trade, virtual company, technological survey auction sales...). 
      </p>
      <p> Some examples: </p>
      <p>The <a href="http://agents.www.media.mit.edu/groups/agents">Software 
        Agents group</a> of the MIT Lab Media develops several projects such as 
        <i>NewT</i> (personalization of the news), <i>Amalthaea</i> (for search, 
        control, and the filtering of the sources of information). <i>Letizia</i> 
        (assisting for search on the WEB). <i>Yenta</i> (kind of yellow page where 
        the users can make knowledge and communicate while keeping their protected 
        personal information), etc. </p>
      <p><a href="http://www.research.microsoft.com/research/ui/persona/home.htm">Microsoft 
        Persona Project</a>: A conversational assistant who interacts with the 
        user in natural language. An initial prototype the <i>Peed</i> parrot 
        was produced to answer the requests of the users in the musical field.

      <p><a href="http://www.ac.com:80/services/cstar/cstr_thought.html">Andersen 
        Consulting</a>: <i>LifestyleFinder</i>, <i>InfoFinder</i> (of the agents 
        which learns offers the preferences from the users and them information 
        while being based on their way of life) <i>BargainFinder</i> (a comparison 
        in real time between the prices of the goods offered on various sites 
        proposes). </p>
